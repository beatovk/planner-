"Sushi Masato","Bangkok’s cult omakase by Chef Masato Shimizu blends Tokyo discipline with New York showmanship at a 10-seat counter. The progression leans Edomae—aging, marinating, and temperature control dialed to the grain of the shari. Service is choreographed but friendly; nigiri feels like a conversation rather than a ceremony. The raw fish is Toyosu-driven and seasonally obsessive. Book far ahead and request counter seats for the full arc."

Seating is tight, pacing unhurried, and conversation minimal by design. It’s a study in restraint and depth."

You’re here for harmony rather than fireworks. Reserve a multi-course set and let the staff steer."
"Yamazato","Bangkok’s classic for formal kaiseki, tempura, and sushi, staged in a serene, timber-lined dining room with teppan alcoves.

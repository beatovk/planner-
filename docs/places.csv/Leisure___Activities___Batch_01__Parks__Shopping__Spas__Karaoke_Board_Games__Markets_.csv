Lumphini Park,"Lumphini Park is Bangkok’s grand central park, a 142‑acre green lung laid out around lakes and broad lawns in the Pathum Wan district. Jogging tracks, open‑air fitness equipment, and nightly aerobics sessions make it a hub for everyday exercise, while paddleboats and kayaking add low‑key fun on the water. Families come for the shaded playgrounds and weekend picnics, and nature lovers keep an eye out for the park’s famous (and harmless) monitor lizards sunning themselves near the banks. Facilities include clean restrooms, lockers, and rentable pavilion space, and cycling is permitted in a designated midday window to keep paths safe for walkers. The park also hosts seasonal fairs and public festivals, and in 2025 the city began works to further modernize amenities and improve food safety with a planned hawker centre outside the Ratchadamri edge. Steps from Sala Daeng BTS and Si Lom MRT, Lumphini is the easiest way to trade Bangkok’s bustle for birdsong and banyan shade in minutes.",https://greener.bangkok.go.th/en/park/suan-lumpini/
Benjakitti Forest Park,"Benjakitti Forest Park expands the original Benjakitti Park into a vast wetland‑and‑woodland landscape, transforming a former tobacco factory into Bangkok’s flagship ‘sponge city’ showcase. Elevated skywalks weave above lotus ponds and reed beds, with long sightlines to the skyline and a lake loop popular with runners and cyclists. The design captures and filters stormwater, creating habitat for birds and butterflies while cooling the surrounding district between Queen Sirikit National Convention Center and Asok. Wide boardwalks, an outdoor amphitheatre, rentals, and rest areas make it equally practical for families, sunset strolls, and photo walks. Since its 2022 full opening, the park has become a symbol of the city’s climate‑resilient green shift and now hosts study visits by urban planners and environmental groups.

Planters with hardy river‑tolerant species bring shade and pollinators to what was once bare infrastructure, with seating nooks that catch breezes above the Chao Phraya. Ramps and an elevator make the crossing accessible, and the walkway’s modest length makes it an easy add‑on to a Chinatown or Old Town itinerary.

Playgrounds, picnic tables, and broad fields draw families and weekend frisbee groups, and there’s a small outdoor gym for body‑weight workouts. In spring, pink trumpet trees bloom along sections of the path, a short‑lived phenomenon that turns the avenue into a pastel arcade. With Queen Sirikit Park next door and Chatuchak Park across Kamphaeng Phet 3 Road, you can string together a long, varied green walk.

Le Du Bangkok	Modern Thai tasting menus built on seasonal Thai produce and precise technique. The room feels intimate yet energetic. Flavors chase balance rather than blunt heat, layering herbs, citrus, and a measured sweetness over clean textures. Dishes land quickly from a focused kitchen, and staff help dial spice levels so first‑timers feel welcome. Portions are built for sharing, which makes it easy to sample across salads, grills, and a curry or two. Regulars know to mix a crunchy snack with one soup for contrast, then finish with something charcoal‑kissed.

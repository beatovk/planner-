1,Rough & Round,Restaurants,"In a city full of coffee spots, some places still manage to stand out – not just for what they serve, but for how they bring people together. An architect and coffee equipment curator has opened a space of their own, a minimalist hideaway designed to foster a sense of community among coffee lovers. The interiors are thoughtfully styled with light wood and soft-toned fabrics from @moonler.furniture, a Thai contemporary brand known for blending craft with calm. The result is a space that feels both refined and welcoming. On the menu, you’ll find single-origin brews from @dakcoffeeroasters, a roastery based in Amsterdam, served in exclusive cups created in collaboration with @mkstudio_cph.

2,Kurasu Thonglor (Sukhumvit 57),Restaurants,"More Kyoto than Bangkok, Kurasu Thonglor is a calm refuge from the usual Thonglor buzz. The space is naturally bright and uncluttered, wrapped in soft timber tones and subtle, easygoing vibes. Signature Bangkok Blend, made from Thai-grown beans, is silky smooth with gentle hints of caramel and berry. There’s even a flavour chart to help you match your mood – from citrusy and floral to deeper chocolate notes.

3,Sauce Coffee at Friend Friend,Restaurants,"When you think of a department store like Emporium, you might expect a cookie-cutter cafe or just another polished retail space but this new corner is anything but typical. They’ve transformed the old parking lot into a creative hub where craft, design and community come together. Think of it as a little village of ideas: there’s Sauce Coffee, serving up aromatic brews made with beans from Gem Forest Coffee.

The space feels both polished and cosy, with a warm mahogany and gold palette divided into three functional zones: an espresso bar, a bakery counter and a slow bar for filter purists. The modular layout uses non-footprint laminate and bold orange marble details to craft everything from menu boards to merch shelves, while Alpi Sottass plywood adds a touch of softness to the cafe's modern angles.

5,Morgen Coffee,Restaurants,"Morgen Coffee, tucked away on Soi Phromsri, brings a quiet pause to the otherwise buzzing Sukhumvit scene. The space is compact yet open, with high ceilings and a clean mix of raw concrete, white tile and pale wood that makes it feel airy and intentional. Coffee here leans Brazilian Arabica – smooth, balanced, and brewed with care. The real standout? Morgen classic, a freshly baked financier that’s buttery, soft and just sweet enough to leave a mark. What sets the place apart is how the light moves through it – brushing against textured walls, mixing with the scent of fresh brewed coffee in the air.

6,Fell Boy,Restaurants,"‘Fell Boy’ might make you think of a kid who fell into some weird hole, but here, it’s more like a cosy little hideout that feels calm and comforting. That’s exactly the vibe of this tucked-away cafe just off Rama 2 Road. Honestly, we’re probably all a bit like that ‘fell boy’, sneaking away to find some chill time. Outside, a lush tropical garden bursts with greenery, creating a contrast to the dry concrete jungle beyond. Inside, warm wood tones and mid-century furniture set a soft, inviting mood. Huge windows frame a small garden nook, blurring the line between indoors and out. Coffee-wise, the cafe keeps it local with Thai beans roasted by Midsummer, offering both light and medium roasts. But if you’re not a coffee fan, their ceremonial-grade matcha is a standout, especially yame clear matcha, which has subtle smokey notes that linger perfectly.

7,Piccolo Vicolo at Wang Burapha,Restaurants,"If you’re exploring the old town, this coffee stop is one of the prettiest perches on the canal. Piccolo Vicolo brings a clean, contemporary pulse to Wang Burapha without losing the old‑town mood. Three adjoining, four‑storey shophouses by Khlong Ong Ang – once a machine storage site – now read as a calm, community‑minded hideout where the original structure meets lush greenery. The layout is smart: a coffee-and-pastry bar with indoor and outdoor seating on the first floor; a library‑like co‑working room on the second floor; an open, plant‑filled terrace with city views on the third; and a surprise on fourth floor – a private‑suite stay called Poco House. The concept leans ‘Discovery & Treasuring,’ preserving original structure while softening it with greenery and quiet corners. The menu suits slow sessions: specialty coffee alongside matcha, sodas and light brunch. Don’t miss the Matcha Coconut or the house Raspberry Soda – both crowd highlights – plus cakes and tarts for the sweet tooth.

8,Cuckoo & Friends,Restaurants,"Nestled within a quiet corner of Ekkamai 21, Cuckoo & Friends might just be your new favourite cafeteria. It feels less like a coffee shop and more like stepping into a friend’s retro-styled living room – complete with warm orange lighting, nostalgic decor and a comforting sense of familiarity. The space is designed to feel like home – one corner is filled with mismatched vintage furniture, analogue knick-knacks and a playlist that leans into mellow moods.

9,Coffee Room Yaowarat,Restaurants,"Tucked quietly into a neighbourhood that doesn’t shout for attention, this cafe is the kind you find once and return to without thinking. The space is all soft whites and stillness, interrupted only by the low hum of a roaster near the entrance. Beans are roasted on-site – blends, single origins, whatever the day calls for – and there’s even an open-door policy for those curious about flavour-profiling or looking to roast their own. Despite its specialty leanings, prices lean gentle: an americano starts at B60, and even an Ethiopian pour, bright with berry, stays within reach. Upstairs, the mood shifts into something more expansive – a co-working floor that doubles as a low-key event space.

10,Leek Coffee,Restaurants,"Set at the end of a quiet soi, Leek Coffee feels more like stepping into someone’s calm weekend morning than a commercial cafe. The kind of place where the clock moves slower and your coffee feels like it was made with actual thought. The space is warm and soft-edged – wooden chairs that don’t look like they came from a catalogue, sunlight filtering through sheer curtains, and a counter stocked with cakes that lean homemade in the best way. The true heart of the space is how naturally it all fits – not minimalist for the sake of it, but perfectly harmonious and just enough.

11,Halfway Brunch & Roastery,Restaurants,"On Soi Ngam Duphli, where the past lingers in low-rise buildings and tangled wires, a new collaboration has appeared between UNFINISHED Coffee Roaster of Wang Hin and PEPE Bangkok from Sukhumvit. The house they share looks as if someone stopped midway through building it – a brutalist shell, bare concrete and awkward lines left to weather – yet the effect is deliberate. Inside, the same offbeat energy continues, a patchwork of chairs and tables, nothing quite matching but everything seeming to belong. The menu leans Australian in spirit: brunch with a wanderer’s passport, folded through with techniques borrowed from elsewhere. Coffee takes centre stage with two blends, one nutty, one fruity, while for those avoiding caffeine there are thick smoothies and sticky s’mores concoctions that make a morning feel like a holiday.

Through glass, you get a backstage pass to the roastery and pastry kitchen – a front row seat to one of the most anticipated cafes of 2025. At the heart of it all is Vee, the owner who won Thailand’s National Barista Champion in 2023. He moved from a cramped Rama 3 spot with one goal – to create a place where every detail works in harmony, so with that in mind pull up a seat as this could become your next go-to coffee shop.

It doesn’t try to compete with the noise outside; instead it slows everything down. The menu features two signature blends from Port Coffee: ‘giant’, a mellow mix of beans from Brazil and Laos, and ‘little’, a lighter, Ethiopia-forward blend. Both are brewed with noticeable patience and meticulous care. Behind the counter, trays of cakes and loaves cool on racks, and their smell drifts out each time the door swings open.

580,Baan Tepa,Restaurant,"Over the past three years, few restaurants in Bangkok have grown and evolved to the same degree as Baan Tepa. What started as a humble 12-seat chef’s table in a previously abandoned ancestral house is now a sprawling, sleek urban farm, cafe, and fine-dining restaurant with a 40-person cooking team. Chef Chudaree “Tam” Debhakam’s almost zealous approach to zero waste and local produce (much of it sourced from the backyard urban garden, more still from farms around Thailand), combined with a menu that is both unique and familiar, put her restaurant in a category of one. The setting matches the theme just as much as the food. The old family house has been reborn with sleek polished woods, soft lighting and splashes of green accents to hint at the urban farm philosophy. Vintage knick-knacks rub shoulders with bold abstract paintings as a mix of old and new pop tunes fill the air. It’s a rejuvenated, cozy space that isn’t afraid to blend old and new worlds. The food and experience at Baan Tepa is special. The restaurant is firing on all cylinders right now, and you will be hard pressed to find a better fine dining experience in Bangkok.

The buzz: Bangkok is no stranger to Indian fine dining—Gaggan, Jhol, Gaa—and this new spot in Langsuan is hosting a whole new crowd for creative eats spanning the subcontinent, with a focus on ingredients and complex flavors that aren’t afraid to get a little spicy. The vibe: It’s big. The smooth, warm design in the century-old Langsuan home seats fifty and is already drawing booked out nights on the weekends. You walk through the doors surrounded by a foggy jungle garden. As you walk in, you’re met by a deep open kitchen and bar seating, with actual fog machines playing against the glass walls. The interior and exterior are beset by curving arches and an impressively lit ceiling on the second floor that gives it a sort of futuristic, mid-century modern appeal. The food: The fare comes from the mind of charismatic head chef Sachin Poojary, with a dining experience that spans the entire subcontinent. The seven-course tasting menu (B3,200) gets off to a delectably nutty start with a Kashmiri morel with khoya and nuts—a real highlight to start things off. The drinks: This a pairing that’s hard not to notice. Storing more than 600 bottles, the pairing is curated by sommelier Thanakorn “Jay” Bottorff featuring a broad, creative range of bottles—including a favorite in the sweet Leeu Passant Stellenbosch Chardonnay—as well as a late meal pairing of a mix of wines with umeshu to kick off your dessert.","A vibrant Indian fine dining experience unfolds in a century-old home featuring creative dishes from across the subcontinent.

583,Hakata Tempura Nagaoka Ekkamai,Restaurant,"The buzz: When you first hear about Hakata Tempura Nagaoka, Ekkamai’s Japanese tempura specialist, you may be mistaken for thinking it’s a high-end omakase-style chef’s table restaurant. This place, however, is a pleasant surprise with its genuinely affordable pricing, offering its crisp tempura starting from a little over a hundred baht.  The vibe: Like many other authentic Japanese spots in Bangkok, Hakata Tempura Nagaoka foregoes the formalities of lavish design for minimalist wooden decor, with the exception of its whimsically adorable illustrations of the fried shrimp hanging at its front door. The venue has only a few seats at the bar where you can see the chef put battered ingredients in to fry.  The food: The restaurant’s owner, Kazauki Shiroma, ran his first branch of Hakata Tempura Nagaoka in Fukuoka alongside his brother for 13 years, garnering a solid fanbase back home. Here, Shiroma sizzles each order in bubbling oil, monitoring constantly for temperature and serves them as soon as they’re fried. We loved the shrimp tempura (B80) served with three types of salt: curry spiced, Himalayan, and housemade tea salt—each providing a unique experience. Next up is the Wagyu Tempura (B250) in which Shiroma uses the kainomi beef cut from the Yamagata prefecture, coating it with a thin layer of batter. The result is a beautifully cooked wagyu with a tender, juicy interior which tastes exquisite when dipped in salt. Another fancier dish on the offer is the uni tempura (B450). Sourcing murasaki sea urchin, Shiroma delivers a decadent, melt-in-your mouth experience which can rival high-quality ingredients served in posh restaurants. Initially puzzled by the inclusion of rice dishes at tempura restaurant—and requests from customers—Shiroma introduced horse crab claypot rice (B500), featuring a massive portion of seafood to share among three. If you have a sweet tooth for Japanese desserts, you can either choose to relish in apple tempura (B150) served with vanilla ice cream or indulge in a decadent French toast tempura (B150). Our favorite was the daifuku strawberry (B250), a half-cut strawberry wrapped in sweet red bean paste, battered and deep-fried. Just remember to let it cool down to avoid the hot bean paste burn.  Why we’d come back: With the quality and level of attentiveness Shiroma brings to the table—along with the variety of his creative offerings for affordable prices—it’s difficult not to fall for Hakata Tempura Nagaoko. If you love tempura, this is by far one of the best spots in Bangkok. By Porpor Leelasestaporn        Photo: Porpor Leelasestaporn","A minimalist wooden decor sets the stage for an authentic tempura experience, where every dish is crafted with care.

584,Kenny's,Restaurant,"The buzz: While there are many places to eat and drink in the residential Ari area, Kenny’s sets itself apart by offering comfort food done well and with a twist. They also stay open from 10am until 3am for the night owls with the midnight munchies. The vibe: From the look outside, this spot might seem just like another neighborhood restaurant but there’s something about them that’s quite inviting. Maybe it’s the logo of a friendly looking cartoon boy, or their cozy looking interiors that split into two floors with the mezzanine overlooking the first floor. But once you take a step inside, you could feel the casualty and that there won’t be any judgment if you want to eat your pizza with ketchup. The food: The pizza game is strong here and the beef burger (B290) is also a must-try. For pizza, get the Smoked It Every Day (B390) with smoked fior di latte, smoked peppered bacon from Larder, red onion, egg, and extra virgin olive oil. You’ve never had toppings like this before, combining smoked cheese, smoked bacon, and the smoke from their oven. On the side, grab the addictive Lays(zy) chips (B120), homemade chips similar to the packets of chips you buy but way tastier (and fresh). Our favorite has to be the corn ribs served with spicy marinara (B180). Crispy baby kale chicken salad (B320) is also a healthier option for those watching their weight. If you don’t feel like pizza or burgers, the baked meatball and cheese with spicy marinara is a good alternative (pork B190/beef B220) The drinks: One of the minds behind this cozy neighborhood restaurant comes from Smiling Mad Dog, one of the biggest craft beer importers in Thailand, so their beer selection isn’t here to play. You’ll get all the favorites like Brewdog Hazy Jane (B320), To Ol City Session IPA (B320), Heart Of Darkness Dream Alone (B260), and the BrewDog Punk IPA on tap (B220). On top of that, you also get a selection of earthy and casual wines like the fun Australian Press + Bloom (Sauvignon Blanc B1,990/Pinot noir B1,990) Why we’d come back: If you’ve walked through Ari before, you know it’s not exactly a pleasant sojourn. With Kenny’s, you mostly walk on the main road, so this spot is easy to get to. Twenty minutes on the train from downtown Bangkok and a four-minute walk from BTS Ari, you’re in a whole new neighborhood with cheaper drinks and food.","A cozy neighborhood spot, comfort food shines with creative twists on pizzas and burgers.

586,Macha,Restaurant,"The buzz: Meandering through the residential lanes of Thonglor Soi 19, you may stumble upon a hidden gem with an irresistibly allure: Macha. This recently opened Korean casual dining venue blends the warmth of intimate Korean classics with a playful twist.  The vibe: Stepping into this cozy three-storey building, you'll feel as though you've been transported to the heart of a quintessential Korean home, from the welcoming white cushioned sofa and dark-wood accents to the delightfully warm orange hue walls. Following the elegant wooden staircase, you'll be led to a spacious second-floor retreat, where the lush, leafy ferns and abundance of natural light enhance the comfortable and inviting ambience. The food:  Despite having macha in the name, the venue doesn’t have anything to do with Japanese green tea. Rather, this place drew inspiration from pojangmacha, the plastic-curtained moving food carts of Korean streets. The owner and young culinary graduate Seokhoon Kang seeks to echo the comfort of these street food carts while offering playful twists to Korean classic dishes. He tells BK that he always dreamt of gently defying conventions when he got his first restaurant. The jangjorim bibim-myon (B240)—a hearty, cold pasta featuring simmering soy-braised beef shredded into chewy strands—brims with umami-rich sweetness. Another highly-praised dish, macha tteokbokki (B320), boasts a large pot of simmered rice cake bathed in gochujang-rich sauce, sausages, and fish cakes that we initially mistook for meatballs. Though not a fan of Korean rice cakes, their addictive quality grows with each bite. Fans of Korean fried chicken can’t miss his macha chicken (B330), a pot of sweet, crispy fried chicken combined with the delicate glaze of sticky, honey-like sweetness and gentle heat. But the real top-notch dish is his French toast (B250); the delicately crisp outer layers—not too sweet or buttery—give way to a pillowy, luscious interior stuffed with custardy kaya. This may sound like an exaggeration, but the dish surpasses other brunch spots that sell this for B300+ for the same offerings.  Why we’d come back: Macha sets itself apart from the typical fusion establishments that, more often than not, value style over substance. With its delightfully intimate ambiance and refreshing take on Korean cuisine, we’re more than confident that Macha will be crowded with food enthusiasts in no time. By Porpor Leelasestaporn","A cozy, three-storey venue offers a warm atmosphere reminiscent of a Korean home, complete with inviting decor and ample natural light.

587,Resonance,Restaurant,"The buzz: If you're a frequent patron of haute cuisine in Bangkok, borderless menus may not be such an original concept with the influx of new wave chef’s tables that emerged during the pandemic—which could be impressive or meh. But among that new wave was Resonance, a borderless fine dining institute tucked away on Sukhumvit Soi 65 where each dish exudes inexplicable charm and a playful edge that teases and satiates your curiosity.   The vibe: Entering the contemporary two-storey building, Resonance might not immediately strike you with impactful visual elements; the dining area is clad in white and minimalistic ornaments with only few decorated photos sparingly hung across the hall. This venue lets their dishes do the talking.    The food: Despite being branded as borderless, there are, indeed, conspicuous nods to Japanese accents interwoven in each plate thanks to capable young chef Shunsuke Shimomura, a former research and development chef for the OG Gaggan. His new seasonal tasting 14-course experience (B6,500) may not blow your mind right away, but the layers of subtlety accumulate and fit into a larger jigsaw. Our experience started with hotaru ika (Japanese firefly squid) topped with creamy burrata and completed with eminently potent crab soup blended with asparagus and bamboo shoots. Hoy mara (murex shell) locally sourced from the Gulf of Thailand, served inside its pink spikey columella, was plump and accentuated with savory mousse, but we wished it had more acidity to add a dynamic edge. We loved the sand white fish, deep-fried piping hot and wrapped in shiso leaf, revealing the luscious interior. Another interesting take was shiro ebi tea soba, in which Shimomura mixed matcha powder with flour. The moderately thick, freshly-made noodle offers refreshing tastes when paired up with the firm and pleasantly chewy shrimp. The showstopper, however, was the spring roll stuffed with crab, cinnamon, pickled ginger, and shredded coconut; there’s a satisfying sensation when you crunch your teeth into this crispy roll bursting with full flavor. Why we’d come back: Shimomura’s creations pack a punch on par with other long-established venues—the prices, too. Something to try next time is the highly-praised tea-pairing (B1,200), which you have to book two days in advance.","A modern, minimalist venue offers a unique borderless fine dining experience with playful Japanese-inspired dishes.

588,Gaston,Restaurant,"The buzz: Spasso has been rebranding its space since last year, but with 31 years of history tied to the name and the place, changing the food was never going to be enough. So, with more hard work, Spasso is dead, long live Gaston—a cooler, hipper French bistro in the basement of Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok. The vibe: You’ll find more color and fun decorations, bringing a livelier atmosphere. Forget what you know about formal hotel dining, Gaston has a casual, inviting vibe and sometimes the smiley chef David Senia walks around the restaurant to make sure everyone is having a good time. The food: The menu isn’t complicated. You’ll be able to find all the casual French bistro favorites here, and that’s exactly what Bangkok needs; mostly restaurants aiming for European cuisine go for the fine dining and luxury aspect. Find casual and easy-to-understand French dishes like the steak frites set (B1,890 / shared between 3 people) where you can choose between Australian black angus ribeye, Australian lamb chop, grilled tiger prawns, and seared sea bass filet—every order comes with unlimited fries. Other French favorites include duck foie gras de canard au torchon served with fig chutney and brioche (B720). The previous menu at Spasso before the new name didn’t have onion soup and we’re glad to see it on the new menu this time (B420). For dessert, you can’t go wrong with the crepes suzette served with Grand Marnier, orange, and vanilla ice cream (B310). Why we’d come back: While Grand Hyatt Erawan still holds strong with that classic hotel image, the team has been working hard to revamp a lot of aspects, especially the food and drinks. This brand-new revamp from a vaunted restaurant is a welcoming one in a city obsessed with European fine dining.","A cooler French bistro in the Grand Hyatt Erawan, the space exudes a casual and inviting vibe with lively decor.

589,The Shoyu Stand,Restaurant,"The buzz: Bangkok may be saturated with ramen joints, but when it comes to those piloted by Shin Inoue, the mastermind behind the instant hit No Name Noodle, your ramen experience will be tougher—way tougher. Just think of him like the Jay Fai of ramen. But there’s good news: His ramen spin-off at J Avenue Thonglor, the Shoyu Stand, is finally out of the box, much more accessible in both price and availability without compromising his unique take on ramen.  The vibe: Frequent visitors to Japan may have seen lots of yatai, those laid-back street vendors with plastic curtains enclosing the seating areas with around five tables. The design concept takes inspiration from the chef’s mother who suggested this seating arrangement would be ideal for a hotter climate, but there’s air-con inside, which means you don’t have to worry.   The food: As the name suggests, the star here is the shoyu ramen, a crowd pleaser for both noodle novices and ramen experts. His current signature menu plays on three thermal senses: hot, cold, and lukewarm. The hot ramen Jidori Shoyu Noodles (B250) see a chicken broth made from local poultry that simmers the hirauchi (flat-shaped) noodles. The noodles are conspicuously thinner than those he used at No Name Noodle, but the flavor is still on point. The cold Hiyashi Niboshi Shoyu Noodles “Shiro” (B270) are perfect to take the edge off the heat with the frozen dashi and refreshingly tangy yuzu shoyu sauce—a nod to the chilled ramen served at his original spot. The main attraction, and perhaps the venue’s signature, is his Cappuccino Noodles (B280). It’s truly a sight to behold with the frothy awa-kei (bubble), filling the broth with rich, creamy truffle taste. When combined with the added toppings (B70)—soft-boiled egg, chashu pork, and bamboo shoots—it’s full of Japanese umami and well-balanced flavors.  Why we’d come back: Although Inoue may not be stationed here at the Shoyu Stand, his protege, who has been with him from the very first days, will take the reins here. The prices are moderately fair, considering that most of the ramen venues in Bangkok start at B200, and with Inoue’s craftiness and the quality, we’d—if we’re lucky enough to secure our seat—stop by again. The staff also shared the tip that if you keep refreshing the online reservation website for every 10 min, there’s a greater chance you will be able to book.

590,Bisou,Restaurant,"The buzz: If you’re tired of Bangkok’s trend of cookie-cutter wine bars that prioritize style over substance, head to this new gastro wine bar in Soi Langsuan, Bisou, where exquisitely crafted French-inspired sharing plates mingle with a meticulously curated of wine list, featuring both unique and lesser knowns bottles.   The decor: Taking over a two-story house that used to be Gaggan’s natural wine bar Wet, the venue has undergone a massive facelift, transforming the former rather dark, dimly-lit space into a sleek and modern semi-glass house with abundant natural light. Stepping inside, you’ll be greeted by a cascade of film posters depicting passionate kiss scenes from movies—think heartthrob Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in their first Amazing Spider. At the center, there’s an oculus on the ceiling which makes the room feel more airy. For more privacy, head upstairs to see the more spacious dining area where you can either hand pick wine bottles from their cellar yourself or let the capable sommelier attend to your needs.   The food: French-born chef Antoine Darquin seeks to capture the mutual charm of a kiss through his French-inspired dishes where patrons can pick creations to share among friends—or of course, lover(s). We loved the bite-sized fried chicken, BFC (B330), marinated in butter, arriving piping hot, topped with salmon roe; the tingling spiciness from shichimi accentuates the dish perfectly. Darquin knows how people are when it comes to brussel sprouts—something he blames on school cafeterias for traumatizing the young people’s taste buds. Served alongside black garlic, razor clams, and creamy emulsion made from curing strips of pork fatback, however, his brussel sprouts (B490) will blow those bad memories away; even those who don’t like vegetables will come around. The real showstopper is his celeriac, truffle risotto (B590). Admittedly, truffles—regardless of their origin and quality—on Bangkok’s food scene are deemed mere ornaments that rarely translate into the chef’s specialty, but this risotto comes with an element of surprise: roasted buckwheat and chestnuts both to provide a crunchy, fun texture to the dish. Don’t miss his dark chocolate souffle served with marjoram (B390); the decadence of this dessert is formidable by itself.  The drinks: A quick look at the wine menu might lead you to believe that this place has less to offer despite its bold claim as a gastro wine bar, but the default wine options start at B360 for white and B390 for red and sparkling. Wave your hand at Theo Lavergne, the French sommelier of the house, and he’ll guide you to the right labels. Those who’re less keen on wine can opt for their cocktails. We particularly liked their Yoko Ono (B400), which features Japanese sake, yuzu, and lavender topped with creamy egg white foam. This place can customize, so feel free to tell the bartender your desires.  Why we’d come back: It’s nice to have a refreshing departure from the mainstream. With both Darquin and Larvergne in the house, Bisou promises to be a vibrant, cool dining spot that caters to those yearning for both great meals and wine lists. Right next to the venue, there’ll be a new Indian fine-dining venue, Indee. We asked around and they said they;ll finish up by the end of April.               Photo: Porpor Leelasestaporn / BK Magazine.","A sleek, modern gastro wine bar offers a delightful mix of French-inspired sharing plates and a curated wine list.

591,Crystal Grill House,Restaurant,"The buzz: Gone are the days of Asiatique as a sad ghost-town; now it looks busier than ever. Disney attractions are set to open, and with Crystal Grill House elevating the space, locals can get in on a spot often thought of as a realm for tourists.  The vibe: Just off-sight behind the merry-go-round, hidden behind the plants, you’ll get a glimpse of several bright glass domes near the river. These domes are soundproofed, so it’s like being in your very own goldfish bowl. You can’t hear anything outside, so it gives you a sense of privacy in the hurly burly. The domes are decorated in different national themes to go with the nearby Sirinahanop ship (operated by the same group) with which the vessel did business in the past.  The food: Even if you’re not a tourist, this steakhouse is definitely worth making the trip. Their appetizers come in a portion so big we thought it was a main. The highlight is the grilled octopus, romesco, new potatoes, and arugula (B680), the thick cut of octopus goes perfectly well with the Catalonia-origin orange sauce, romesco. From the grill, the options go from salmon steak (B680) to a bone-in Black Angus ribeye (B5,800), but the must-try has to be the wagyu ribeye (B3,800); the red sauce for the beef is more buttery than any steak sauce you’ve ever had. Those who don’t eat beef, apart from the salmon, can get in on the choices of pork chop (B780) and jumbo tiger prawn (B1,280). For dessert, their Japanese cheesecake topped with mixed berries (B190) and flan (B160) is just beautiful. For your sides, we recommend the charcoal-roasted pumpkin in agrodolce sauce with pine nuts, chili, and raisins (B140). The drinks: There are five signature cocktails—all are refreshing and easy-drinking—named and inspired by the countries for which the domes are decorated; each cocktail uses iconic ingredients from the country of choice. For example, Japan sees gin, vanilla, citrus, sparkling water, and matcha foam. All cocktails are priced at B400, and a wine list is also available. Why we’d come back: Though Asiatique is not usually on the top of our list, when we look for a place to hang out, this new addition to the area is definitely worth checking out. It really takes the riverside up a notch.","A hidden gem near the river, this steakhouse features soundproof glass domes adorned with national themes for a unique dining experience.

592,Nawa Central Thai Cuisine,Restaurant,"The buzz: The power chef couple from Samlor (previously 80/20) Napol “Joe” Jantraget and Saki Hoshino have just opened a new fine-dining restaurant serving Thai food. One of the great talents from Samlor, Jirapat “Sep” Praphotjanaporn, will be taking the helm here. The vibe: Leave everything you know about Samlor at the door for Nawa Central Thai Cuisine because you won’t find any signs of it here. As you walk in, dark walls and high ceilings with colorful details give off a slightly mysterious but extravagant feel. Then you’ll come across a large, bright open kitchen with the team working in perfect synchronicity. The food: The menu when we visited served 14 courses at B3,800. The journey starts with small bites of snacks like ma-hor (seasonal citrus with sweet pork paste), an ancient recipe for a Thai snack. With culinary skills in their pomp, you might not recognize the dish when it’s set in front of you, but expect some flavors you know. For example, for a starter, their take on koong chae nam pla sees fresh, cold mantis shrimp served with nam jim seafood granita. The main course comes in a Thai sharing style with different dishes arriving at almost the same time and unlimited rice. Thailand’s arguably most famous dish, tom yum koong is served here with river prawn and coconut foam; the nam prik puu (crab relish) here is served with plenty of blue crab meat, crab gel and topped with caviar from Hua Hin. Wagyu panang (red curry) is another comforting dish. For your fruity pre-dessert, expect items such as seasonal fruit and cape gooseberry loy kaew (ice and syrup) in jasmine syrup. For the real dessert, you’ll get a bowl of chocolate from Chantaburi and some bananas, as Chef Hoshino wants to showcase Thai chocolate. There are also other tiny bites for dessert afterward, so save room. Why we’d come back: This is not the place to go seeking out extreme fusion or anything out-of-this-world, but we think that is a good thing because it’s a fine dining menu that still offers the comfort you need and is filling.","A fine-dining experience awaits with a menu showcasing modern Thai flavors crafted by talented chefs.

593,Rolling Ribs Brew Bar and BBQ,Restaurant,"The buzz: Thanks to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest held in Tennessee every year, Memphis’s unique style of barbecue has been growing in fame and popularity. Lucky for us Bangkokians, we can get a taste of that minus the ridiculously long flight at Le Meridien Bangkok’s Rolling Ribs Brew Bar and BBQ. The vibe: It’s half alfresco, half indoors; being a smokehouse that helps with the smoke and heat. This means you can take a seat inside with the air con close to Surawong Road and open windows. This is a casual place that serves seriously good grilled fare with a street vibe while keeping the comfort and treatments of a five-star hotel. The food: If you’re dining with two friends, it’s highly recommended to get the All Star Combo Platter (B1,995) so you can try all of their signatures. The platter includes a half a rack of smoked pork spare ribs, slow smoked pulled pork shoulder, 200g cured beef brisket, half smoky organic barbeque chicken, two smoked sausages (one pork, one beef), and five sides: dry tangy slaw, corn on the cob, corn bread, baked potato, and potato wedges. They also offer three kinds of barbecue sauce: normal, tangy, and spicy. Why we’d come back: If you love Billy’s Smokehouse in Ploenchit, or Smokin’ Pug in Lang Suan, you have to add this place to your must-try list for all your barbecue lovers.","A smokehouse with a casual vibe, this venue blends indoor comfort and alfresco charm.

594,Mer Made Cantina,Restaurant,"The buzz: Tinned food in Thailand is usually dismissed as cheap and uncreative. But if you look at food trends, tinned food has been garnering more attention globally, and there are several gourmet-level tinned foods with a rich history. Hopping on this trend is Mer Made Cantina, a newly opened tapas spot with only four tables in Ladprao that aims to showcase gourmet tinned fish and locally sourced seafood delicacies.  The decor: There’s a bucolic charm lingering in the air of this tapas place, with heaps of straws, open-air space, and chickens the owners keep as pets; we thought they sold the chickens and asked them to their face and were embarrassed. But the space is set to evolve. There will be more venues to come, namely a pizzeria, sustainable-focused cafe, and boozy ice cream stall.  The food: It’s a combination of bite-sized small plates and well-portioned delicacies. The owner sources quality-tinned fish from Europe, namely Portugal, while maintaining close contacts with local suppliers in the South. The heirloom tomatoes and Moroccan sardines (B280), for instance, boast zesty sardines served with vibrantly colored heirloom tomatoes. The shrimp cocktails (B280) sit within the beds of mashed avocado with pronounced traces of wasabi, whereas the saltwater shrimps (B380) sourced from Phuket radiate freshness with a chimichurri sauce. The highlight, however, is the Mer Made pizza with Moroccan sardines and tomato sauce (B340); the sweet acidity of the tomatoes make a delicious contrast to the salty sardines. Wash them down with their natural red wine sangria sorbet (B240).  The drinks: Mermaid Cantina also boasts a vast array of natural wines, starting at B390 by the glass and B1,600 bottles, including Ultra Violet de David, by Les Vins Pirouettes, a natural red from Alsace, France.  Why we’d come back: Ladprao is usually overshadowed by Ari’s hip, chic energy and usually associated with more residential vibes. But with Mer Made Cantina, as well as their hopeful additions to the space, the area could become another hip and happening community.

596,Kiri Tsukemen,Restaurant,"The buzz: The people behind Thonglor’s beloved Kansai udon specialist Tsuru recently unveiled Kiri Tsukemen their new joint specializing in tsukemen, a separate bowl of freshly made noodle paired with various dipping sauces. Each option arrives with a burning stone bowl to keep your experience going.  The decor: Situated above the building next to its elder sister joint, Kiri Tsukemen is as compact as it gets, with an L-shaped wooden counter bar enclosing the kitchen where heat and smoke from the noodle making takes over the entire space. Choose a seat in the middle of the counter to see chefs rolling their tsukemen into shape for the bowls.  The food: The menu—just like its compact space—sees their thick, bouncy noodles (B350) laden with slices of sous vide pork shoulder, fermented bamboo shoot menma, and perfectly soft boiled egg with a dipping sauce of your choice. Here, you get to choose from five different dipping sauces, boasting both tonkotsu (pork bone) and chicken bone broth. We loved the seabura, a simmering broth made from pork back fat, with an end result that is delicate, yet rich, bursting with sheer umaminess. Those who want to prick their taste buds with intense burning flavors can go for their kara tsukemen, a boiling hot bowl of tonkotsu broth sprinkled with piquant chili powder; the owner tells that if that doesn’t satisfy you, simply add their homemade rayu (Japanese chili oil sauce) to shake your senses. If you prefer something lighter, try their yuzu shio, subtly sweet but not too sour from the citrus—so refreshing you won’t notice where all of your noodles went. Once you run out of the noodles, order a bowl of rice and pour it into the dipping bowl to enjoy the rice porridge. There’s also the cold ramen option, hiyashichuka (B350), offering a mouthwatering slurp of chilled noodles and velvety slices of chashu.  Why we’d come back: People lining up for ramen are nothing new in Bangkok. But for tsukemen, it's a somewhat different story as the sheer number of the latter can’t hope to compete. At Kiri Tsukemen, this place ticks all the boxes people are looking for in ramen joints: hearty portions, variation, and a somewhat close proximity to public transport. All of that said, we’re quite sure Thonglor office people will bookmark this place for their lunch and afterwork meal.

597,Yankii Robatayaki and Bar,Bar,"The buzz: Soho Hospitality—the team behind Above Eleven, Cantina, Havana Social, Soho Pizza, and Charcoal Tandoor Grill—has birthed their latest baby, Yankii, a Japanese restaurant in Robatayaki style, equipped with a full bar. The vibe: Robatayaki is basically fireside-style dining, where you get to sit next to a bunch of ingredients and a charcoal-lit stove. You can ask them to grill everything you see in front of you. It’s fun, lively, and super casual with the staff shouting their welcomes as soon as you walk in. The dining area is on the upper floor above the bar—inspired by Dagashi shops from the 50s and their colorful candies—to continue your drinking upstairs with the grilled bites. The food: While the vibe is fun and it’s overall a good experience, the prices are on the expensive side for what you get. They do their vegetable dishes really well. The shiitake mushroom grilled with soy sauce comes particularly juicy, but there’s a price to pay: B120 for three pieces. The padron pepper with soy sauce and bonito flake (B180) and asparagus with ponzu and bonito flake (B120) are also a must-try. For the meat, obviously you can’t go wrong with the wagyu hand-roll with uni (B480). The yankii salmon with pickled onion and chipotle sauce (B380) is done well; it’s how a salmon dish is supposed to taste. Other grilled chicken dishes like the wings with black pepper (B120), heart with yuzu pepper (B120), and thigh with leek and sea salt (B120) also make for good drinking snacks. However, leave out the yankii hotdog (B280). The drinks: Signature cocktails have a light, fun Japanese twist. Negroni drinkers must order the Minneopa, which switches your typical vermouth to Taru Nakata barrel-aged umeshu, mixing with Roku gin and Campari (B360). Funky Genji is another one of our favorites, with sake as a base, ginger, honey, and balsamic vinegar (B380). Kirin beer is B240 and a Sapporo draft is B280/330ml; B450/640ml. Sake by the bottle is also available from B1,400 for a fresh and sharp Ozeki Karatamba Nama Chozo.Why we’d come back: On our last visit, we dined upstairs and treated it as a dinner place, while drinking on the side. However, this place might be more fitting as a bar, somewhere you head over just to drink and maybe snack on the side, but we wouldn’t go there on an empty stomach.","A lively Japanese restaurant offers a unique robatayaki dining experience where guests can enjoy grilled dishes right from the charcoal stove.

With an orange metallic roof, steel uncomfy chairs at the bar, and table seatings with concrete floors, the place is reminiscent of street side food stalls. Hit it early to enjoy the view and sunset or round up your friends for a night out.   The food: With the craze on mala beef skewers in Bangkok, owner Arthit “Fai” Mulsan, formerly a morlam arts curator for the art space and Isaan culture scholar, believes Isaan food culture could do better. So, he began experimenting on his larb siab creations from scratch, starting by selecting part of the beef to hone taste profiles. The result was larb siab: addictive, bite-sized skewers complete with toasted rice powder, bird’s eye chilis, lime juice, and fish sauce. His basic skewers, ranging from B30-40 per bite, include beef onglet, shank, duck thigh, and pork intestines—dried and crispy on the outside as they should be. His special bites see Isaan sausage (B40) stuffed—and later torched—with cheese, a combination we never saw coming but we have to admit it’s delightful in an unusual way. There are also vegetarian options available, from grilled eggplants and okra to orinji mushroom, all finished with his homemade nam prik pao sauce.  Why we’d come back: While Bangkok may never experience a shortage when it comes to finding rooftop drinking spots, Larb Siab offers a very affordable spot and cheap food to pair with your beer drinking.

Coming hot on their heels is Dosan Dalmatian, a brunch spot promising a heady mix of Western and Korean dishes, photogenic desserts, and glasses of wine with a backdrop of delightfully twee decor.  The decor: The Dalmatian here in Bangkok may not boast the same degree of aesthetics as its original location in Seoul—with an obvious lack of rustic looking stone pillars and arched doorways—but the the four-storey building is filled with plenty of visual appeal and Dalmatian motifs, ranging from the iconic black spots and anthropomorphic dog portraits. Sit on the second or third floor with large pane windows overlooking the neighborhood, or head upstairs for its rooftop terrace during the evening where a water fountain filled with flower petals might remind you of the original location. You can also bring your furry friends to the rooftop on one condition: you must carry them up to the fourth floor yourself.   The food: The menu ticks all the boxes for an all-day-brunch cafe — plenty of things made with eggs, pancakes, and bacon. Start off with truffle aioli pancake (B260) featuring two fluffy pancakes with sunny side up eggs and rich creamy sauce on top, or the melted cheese sandwich (B350) for something more filling. The ultimate breakfast set dubbed as “Dalmatian breakfast” (B490) sees an omelet accompanied by avocado, bacon, sausage, and bread. Those with sweet tooth can start their day with Dalmatian’s signature strawberry pancake (B420), a staggering tower of pancakes stuffed with mascarpone and thick cream topped with strawberries, or go for the crunchy french toast with fresh berries (B470) featuring crispy coconut bits and a zesty berry sauce. The place also has some creative dishes like kimchi pancakes (B360), which have a crunchy bite and mildly sweet heat. There is also a kimchi fried rice dish (B360) that reminds us of risotto topped with cheese and an egg yolk.

602,Irie Bangkok,Bar,"​​Dance and eat Jamaican dancehall-style at a longtime Bangkok DJ bar/restaurant that has reopened just off Khaosan Road. Irie Bangkok - Jerk, Tunes & Tings is where DJ Orawan “Elle” Suppasuphawat hosts bass- and dub-heavy nights, and the kitchen serves jerk-cooked Jamaican fare. “It is the only Jamaican restaurant in Bangkok that provides music as well,” Orawan says. “We want to deliver music culture with food. If people love drum ‘n bass music, then they’ll know where to be.” The venue, which operated for a while on Ekkamai, is throwing a grand opening party on Jan 14 headlined by the Dub Pistols’ frontman Barry Ashworth, who will bring down everything from dub and ska to jungle and punk. For about two years, Irie Bangkok hosted live gigs at its Ekkamai location, which Orawan opened with her boyfriend Bradley Hart.  “I’ve been wanting to have a bar for awhile,” Orawan said. “And then, when I met Bradley, he wanted to have a restaurant, so we combined our passion together.” Hart is responsible for what’s cooking in the kitchen.  All the chicken is marinated over 24 hours in “jerk” seasoning, a mix of common herbs and spices, before being cooked low and slow over a charcoal grill. Get a jerk-marinated chicken leg for B120 or get the eight-piece 420 Special for, well, B420. At the bar, signature cocktails include the Rum & Roots, a splash of rum, ginger, honey, lime, and soda; or The Painkiller, which mixes kratom with rum and coconut nectar. Both are B160. Ashworth plays at 9pm on Jan 14, supported by DJs Orawan, Brad-Roc, Kingkong Killa, Klynton, and Animal. Tickets including one drink are B500 online or B600 at the door. Irie Bangkok is located at 48 Chakrabongse Road, a short walk from Sanam Luang or the Phra Arthit pier in Bangkok’s Phra Nakhon district.This article originally appeared on our media partner, Coconuts Bangkok.","A vibrant DJ bar and restaurant serves authentic Jamaican jerk dishes alongside bass-heavy music nights.

604,Sorellina,Restaurant,"Since the end of November, the space in front of Sukhumvit Soi 38’s H Dining—now called H Space—has turned into a new outdoor pizza spot, Sorellina, and you should add it to your pizza list. Operated and run by the former Six Senses executive chef and consulting executive chef for Capella global, Todd Adams has been cooking for corporations for 28 years and now he is after something simple—though his experience can still be found in the detail on the dishes. His menu is easy to understand and you’ll see a lot of familiar words but not usually found together. For example, his burrata salad takes on thin slices of persimmon instead of chunky cuts of tomatoes, with pumpkin seeds, ikura, and nasturtium oil (B360); as simple as that sounds, it makes a big difference. For the pizzas, there are nine toppings available on the menu separated by red and white. Adams’ version of the four cheese pizza plays with truffled honey and fresh oregano (B480). While most truffle dishes are usually overwhelmed by truffle smell, this pizza is surprisingly balanced and you’ll still taste the cheeses. The best-selling pizza is the Soppressata (B540), nduja, ligurian olive, caper and smeared stracciatella on top. This one is big, bold flavors, but all the ingredients shine without stealing the spotlight. The dough is kind of sourdough-ish but still holds it together, soft but still a little chewy.     View this post on Instagram           A post shared by sorellina (@sorellinapizza.th)","A new outdoor pizza spot offers a fresh take on classic dishes with unique ingredients.

606,Alpea,Restaurant,"The buzz: After making a grand comeback with his eponymous Maison Dunand, one of Bangkok’s most vaunted French chefs, Arnaud Dunand, has unveiled his bistro spin-off Alpea, sitting atop his grocery store next to his fine-dining establishment. Here, Dunand focuses more on comfort food drawn from his childhood growing up in the French Alps around the Savoie region. The grocery shop downstairs features imported products from modest producers in Savoie, ranging from the upland Tomme de Savoie cheese and dry hazelnut sausage (B245/100g) to the chef’s ready-to-made onion soup and cooking essentials.  The vibe: Alpea exudes a sense of rustic charm with sunlight filtering through the large lounge window panes—perfect for a peaceful escape with an aura of freshly baked pastries on display. Ascending the staircases, you’ll find intricate wood beams and stone walls much like those used in Maison Dunand but this place sports a cozier look thanks to the plush furniture.  The food: Despite Dunand’s claim to embracing simplicity, you’ll easily find high-level techniques and elegant presentations radiating from one dish to another. Start off with the classic foie gras terrine (B880) marinated in cognac and served with Chignin Bergeron spherized into zesty jellies; the rich velvety texture melts pairs with the flaky crust of the accompanying brioche. His signature beef tartar (B980), lightly dressed with creamy Utah oysters, offers a satisfying bite thanks to the crunchy, aromatic mustard seeds on top. Another simple dish highlighting two key ingredients—pasta and cheese—is the cheese fondue ravioli (B750) in clear pork stock consomme with goji berries infused with French herbal liqueur Chartreuse. There’s admirable creativity in his fish quenelle (B980), as the chef mixes white sea bream with cream and forms an egg-like shape; we love the light creaminess combined with tangy brightness of Chignin Beurre Blanc. The real highlight, however, goes to his Cantal farmed pig (B1,350) featuring tantalizingly juicy pork belly with confit apples and mustard. The balance of sour and sweet from the apples chaperones the fatty cut, offering a moreish pleasant taste. Those arriving in large groups can also order the mussels marinieres cream (B980), a giant pot of mussels served in white wine and onion, each bursting with natural sweetness. End your meal with the Grand Marnier souffle (B450), a cloud-like confectionery made with orange-flavored liqueur and served with thick vanilla cream.  Why we’d come back: Arnaud Dunand’s gastronomic creations have never been more accessible—considering you expect him in his default haute mode. The prices, if we are bluntly honest, might scare some patrons away, but there are more things to be offered at Alpea, with its grocery items and freshly made pastry–well, we could say we’d love to come back anytime for that caramelized crust of his cannelle (B80).

608,Fatboy Izakaya,Restaurant,"The buzz: The minimalist  Saladaeng, Fatboy Sushi, got an upgrade at their new, much bigger home in Ekkamai with a new name: Fatboy Izakaya. They’re offering more than just sushi, with modern izakaya dishes and a long alcohol list in their two-storey building. The vibe: Taking over the late Wine Bibber Sangria (RIP) spot, the space offers two floors decorated in Japanese kitsch that we grew up with, from manga plastered all over the wall and Japanese action figures to pixel-art of sumo wrestlers. You’ll be able to spot the place from miles away with their shining bright lights out of their front glass wall, showcasing the live, party atmosphere inside. Upstairs is a little more private with a balcony overlooking the busy neighborhood, equipped with a cold kitchen/sushi bar. Ekkamai has definitely not seen anything like this before. The food: Modern Japanese with a fun twist, good for drinking and socializing. The signature Fatboy Roll (wagyu maki, cream cheese, truffle oil with foie gras on top, B650 / eight pieces) is on the menu and is a must-try. Their vegetable dishes aren’t boring either, try crispy cauliflower served with fermented chili mayo dipping sauce (B180); charred eggplant served with tomato ohitashi and ginger soy dressing (B220); and cannot-be-missed sizzling padron peppers served with lemon and extra virgin olive oil (B240) for some spice. Their Japanese take on beef tartare is made with wagyu, comes with wasabi pickles and egg to be eaten on nori chips (B450). Another must-try beef dish is the simple and traditional gyozas however with wagyu beef stuffed inside, served with chili soy dressing (B280). For non-beef eaters, and if you had to order just one thing from this menu, make it tonkatsu pork chop (B450). The drinks: Their take on different flavors of highball is simple but refreshing (elderflower, shochu, yuzu, passionfruit, B250 each). The heartbroken might want to try the Let That Man-Go, packed with two strong spirits—wasabi tequila and mezcal—with cointreau mixed with toasted sticky rice and mango puree and Greek yogurt (BB350). For something a little more complex, go for the I Don’t Give a Shiit-ake, stirring shiitake mushroom infused bourbon with orange oleo Saccharum and maple caramel syrup (B380). A three-liter of Sapporo draft is available for B1,400. Sake, shochu, umeshu, and all kinds of wine are also available. Why we’d come back: This is not the kind of dinner place where you leave sober, whether going alone, with friends, family, or a company outing. The space just makes it fun for you to drink, even if it’s just a glass of highball or draft Sapporo.

Plus, their playlist is absolute fire with Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B, Drake, and Tyler, the Creator blasting on the speakers. You can come here in your comfy clothes.  The food: Looking at the menu, you might think you’re at your late-night khao tom (rice soup) place, Saeng Chai. But when the dishes actually roll out, you’ll see they are not your typical dishes. For example, their goong chae nampla (Thai-style prawn ceviche) comes minced instead of as a whole prawn like what you’ve seen and served on romaine lettuce, B120 per piece. Their version of moo ping (grilled pork on stick) comes as smoked pork ribs and served with this sweet tamarind-y jaew (B780). Another refreshing dish to go with your beer, the yum pla foo (sour mango salad with crispy fish) is also a must-try (B340). However, the real deal is their khai jeaw (Thai style omelette), The Samlor thai omelette (B280) comes as fluffy as a cloud, and once you cut it open, it has creamy, lava yolk inside, served with hot jasmine rice from Yasothon with chili, garlic fish sauce, and their homemade chili sauce. Chef Joe also focuses on using as many local ingredients as possible and he’s one of the few people supporting the local fish industry; he serves a menu on his special chalkboard based on what the fishers can catch. Dessert comes from mastermind chef Saki Hoshino who is also behind the ice cream brand, Yora. Her take on Thai dessert tub tim krob plays on coconut milk granita instead of coconut milk (B280).

611,Maison Dunand,Restaurant,"The buzz: Back in the day when it felt like fine-dining restaurants were few and far between in Bangkok, French chef Arnaud Dunand helped make Le Normandie one of the preeminent fine-dining destinations in the city. During his reign, Dunand managed not only to earn two Michelin stars, but also a perfect five-star rating from BK’s own food reviewers. Though the chef left his post at the French powerhouse in  10. Despite only being open for a few months this year, it has already received a one-star rating in 2023’s Michelin Guide.  The vibe: Rather than a flashy showpiece venue, Dunand’s new post feels homey and rustic. You won’t find any elaborate chandeliers or gold-colored carpet to create an inflated sense of exuberance. The two-story house is modeled after the typical chalets found Dunand’s hometown in the French Alps. Here, oakwood beams and cave-like stone walls commingle with cabin-in-the wood feels from the lush green garden outside. The venue also sits right next to his more casual French bistro, Alpine, where Dunand forgoes haute cuisine in favor of more personal recipes from his hometown. The food: Food-wise, Dunand showcases his French culinary prowess and soft personal touch in ways meant to remind you of his hometown. His eight-course experience (B6,900) begins with a smoked eel canape, alongside three amuse bouches: blood sausage with a tangy green apple gel, vol-au-vent (a small pastry filled with mushroom ragu and topped with truffle foam), and trout roe tartlet. The first course arrives with pieces of smoked sardine and beef neatly arranged into a rose shape with black radish. A tomato consomme and heap of herbs chaperon the dish and result in a refreshingly creamy but light mouth feel that prepares your palette for the next offering. Dunand’s old-time signature move, caviar with sea urchin and potato soup, will still woo guests as a rich and salty delicacy. Later, Dunand flexes his creativity with a lobster dish (we’re talking rare blue lobster from Brittany) seared with blueberry sauce and served with creamed celeriac and lobster bisque. Tantalizingly sweet and subtly acidic, you’ll make good use of the provided bread to wipe the plate clean. Equally satisfying is the wild pollack, which is slow-cooked in oil and wrapped with crunchy cabbage and pike roe. All of this is before getting to the main course. While there are two options, the fig-smoked Bresse pigeon we tried (with sprinklings of cacao nibs and served alongside eggplant millefleurs) was hearty and excellent. The course is buffered by a selection of Alpine cheese, which rolls out on a trolley boasting 10 varieties from Dunand’s hometown, before wrapping up the meal with a billowing chocolate sponge cake topped with chocolate mint ice cream. It might sound like a lot, but it’s extremely satisfying.  Why we’d come back: Dunand is nearly a living legend in Bangkok’s fine-dining scene, especially among the old guard. Considering that his new place offers a business lunch menu at B2,600—very reasonable considering the quality on offer here—we’d say Maison Dunand could easily slip into your regular rotation for years to come. Also thanks to the chef’s cafe-slash-bistro right next door, having a taste of legend’s work is easier than ever.

612,Zao Larb,Restaurant,"The buzz: The Isaan food hype reached new heights with the arrival of Zao, Ekkamai’s Isaan food specialist with the nostalgic flavors of unapologetic northeastern classics. Now, owner Nutthida “Eve” Palasak has opened the spin-off Zao Larb on Thonglor Soi 25, focusing on more adventurous and lesser known dishes—som teen ngua (fermented ox feet) and som suer (fermented beef brisket wrapped in bamboo leaves)—and even raw beef delicacies including soi ju and goy. The vibe: Taking over a two-storey house in a small sub soi in Thonglor, this place looks surprisingly similar to its first branch in Ekkamai, with a sleek, photogenic design you wouldn’t expect from places selling Isaan dishes on the street. The rough concrete is balanced with brown wood furniture and design pieces, which, again, are a nod to the owner’s bold emphasis with northeastern artists. On our last visit, the second floor wasn’t complete yet, but we can see that it will offer more privacy for large groups.  The food: Unlike the homey dishes served at Zao, Zao Larb takes you on a tour to the region’s textural depth to daring routes where most adventurous eaters—and those who try to avoid them—bristle. The idea of putting raw beef in your system sounds scary, but that’s pretty normal in the culinary world if you think about it—beef tartare or even ceviches, anyone? Here, the raw beef sliced into bite-sized bundles, soi ju (B320), is packed with chewy beef tripe and liver served with bitter dipping sauce. The five-minute som seur (B350) features beef brisket wrapped in banana leaf; the beef is perfumed from the inside with herbaceous stuffing before streaming under coal for five minutes to elevate the flavor. We also love the larb pla pbeung (B250) made with black ear catfish caught and sent from her hometown. The texture was plump and delicately well-seasoned. The same goes for the larb ped sam dao (B320), a medley of duck meat, crispy skins, and duck offal flagrantly seasoned and served with pickled garlic Eve’s mother pre-made a year ago. Jaew hon, Isaan’s answer to hotpot, is available for two options: assorted slices of Sri Saket’s A5 Tamaji Lamduan beef (starting at B1,950) or all-star fish from Ubon Ratchathani (B2,850), both perfect for sharing. Wash them down with som teen ngua (B320) with fermented ox feet that gave us the impression of eating a soup version of nhaem.  The feet and tendons are slow-cooked until they look and taste like jelly—mellowing all the fiery flavors. Why we’d come back: Zao Larb invites you to dig deeper than the usual comfort of Isaan cuisine; we asked our Isaan friends and they told us that they can’t find dishes like this in Bangkok. The price might be a little bit discouraging for anyone who normally dines on northeastern dishes, but for those who haven’t, the comfort, along with its cool, hipsterish vibe, makes it more accessible.

Few seats and tables are available, and at some point the place might get so crowded that lines extend across the street.

614,Sushi Saryu,Restaurant,"The buzz: If you’re a true sushi aficionado, the name of chef Seiji Sudo is on your wishlist. After leaving his post as a head chef from Singapore’s Ginza Sushi Ichi and Thonglor’s six-seat omakase Tama, chef Sudo brings his omakase mastery to Sathorn with the newly-unveiled Sushi Saryu at Kronos Building. The vibe: Amidst the plain-looking office building is an unassuming wooden sign that leads to the restaurant’s cave-like entrance. Reaching the other end, you’ll be greeted with Sudo’s intimate, zen space with an eight-seat counter—an upgrade from his former spot with two—laden with colorful sake glasses handpicked by Sudo himself. Ask him to see what’s inside the wooden cabinet behind him and Sudo will proudly present pictures and souvenirs received from his cherished fans he has gathered over the years.  The food: Roughly translated as “sand flowing through an hourglass” in Japanese, Saryu embodies Sudo’s 10 years of training and his tireless dedication to curating rare finds and quality ingredients for his omakase style. His 15-course experience (B8,000) started with chutoro, a cut of fatty tuna belly on a bed of crispy and subtly sweet seaweed from Saga Prefecture. It’s followed by uni soup; Sudo chose Bafun sea urchin with bold and slightly bitter notes with the sweetness from kombu seaweed stock, adorned with nothing more than salt.  Autumn also brings sanma, Japanese Pacific saury, a name synonymous with the season. Sudo sliced some of its gelatinous silver-red flesh and served it nigiri style made from three different rices—a secret the chef holds to even when asked. Yakisushi—the baked sushi rice mixed with hairy crab, uni, beltfish, dried mullet roe, and shirako (fish semen)—may sound a little intimidating, but the dish gives off a rich, creamy texture with an addictive flavor. Among our favorites was the Botan Ebi whose strikingly green-hued shrimp roe caught our attention. The natural green stems from the shrimp’s defense mechanism to blend its roes to avoid predation, but well, here they are anyway, with its rich sweet taste radiating over your palette. For the parting shot, Sudo compiles all of the ingredients he had used in the day—which rotates on occasion—to deliver as maki, combining both Bafun and Mirasuki sea urchins, salmon roe, and shima ebi, all topped with shrimp roe and wrapped in seaweed.    Why we’d come back:  Just like its cave-like entrance, an experience at Sushi Saryu equips you with new perspectives as the sushi master’s craft evolves. The prices may be a deal-breaker for some, but if you’re planning to have a lavish meal that doesn’t betray all the baht that you have to spend, Sushi Saryu should come as one of the top places.

615,Côte by Mauro Colagreco,Restaurant,"The buzz: For some foodies, a high-end restaurant means accolades and awards hanging at the door. For others, it’s where every dish speaks passionately about the chefs and those behind the counter. At Capella’s Côte, you're blessed with both—helmed by none other than Italian-Argentine chef Mauro Colagreco whose prestigious awards would take up this piece’s word count. In short, Colagreco is the first non-French chef to earn three Michelin stars from his French fine-dining restaurant Mirazur, which also topped the World’s Top 50 Best Restaurants the same year. Though not physically here in Bangkok, Colagreco has passed the white robe to chef Davide Garavaglia, a former Chef de Cuisine of Mirazur, who fashions a rotating menu of seafood delicacies in Mediterranean-style.   The vibe: It's the kind of swank where you imagine closing every business deal of your life one sitting. Sitting above Capella Bangkok, Côte has touches of modernity with pops of warm, reddish brown furniture and blends of cream and light gray palettes. The wide, floor-to-ceiling windows allow in an abundance of natural light and a majestic view of the Chao Phraya River.   The food: Côte in French means the coastline, and the dishes here are inspired by the Southern French-Italian riviera cities, from Nice and Genoa, reinterpreted into more contemporary dishes. Here, Davide Garavagil has designed several tasting menu options, ranging from the Escapade Lunch (B1,800/4 courses) to the Carte Blanche (B6,500/9 courses) to choose from. Our coastal journey, Côte Experience (B4,100/5 courses), began with five amuse bouches (which rotate daily). We loved the beetroot macaron with a crisp green apple slice that works well with a modestly pungent goat cheese. The first course arrived as Brittany crab burrata with creamy texture and a great interplay with a light acidity from the green tomato sorbet. The white cod with cauliflower and caviar is paired with the delightfully complex sake sauce. The slow-cooked octopus—topped with artichoke chips, wild mushrooms, and thick tamarind sauce—gives off a good chewy texture. The highlight, though, was his signature French pigeon with a ‘fake’ olive; the pigeon liver mousse is wrapped in black olive skin. Our course ended with Thai coriander ice cream topped with popcorn powder, which surprised us in the way it didn’t compromise on unique taste but still elevated the dish’s overall taste profile.  The drink: Arguably the largest selection of grower champagne in Thailand, Côte currently boasts over 200 to 300 champagne labels in their arsenal. Here, you can either choose to go with their regular wine selection, starting at B2,500 for five wine pairing, or the grower champagne selection at B3,300. On our last visit, the pairing was meticulously well-done, particularly the yogurt sake Mikuru that paired perfectly with the coriander ice cream.  Why we’d come back: One of the strongest points that we’d give to Côte is the amount of care and attention each staff member pours into their service. Each time you visit the place, the staff begins personalizing your course menu to ensure you get a unique experience. The prices for their lunch menu aren’t that bad either, even comparatively cheaper than the newbies’ so-called chef tables.

616,Larder,Restaurant,"The buzz: Chef Radek Zarębiński—formerly of Gaggan and now owner of Sukhumvit Soi 12’s LA Mexican food truck space Cholos and The Commons Thonglor—and chef Adrian Klonowski, previously of Gaa, have joined forces to open Larder, serving all-day sandwiches and coffee in an industrial vibe right in the heart of Phrom Phong. The vibe: A large open kitchen with only the cashier separating customers and the team at work, random plants in their own store-bought black plastic pots, bare concrete and random pink and green details here and there, Larder offers simplicity with fine detail, a facet that reflects in their food. You can expect unpretentiously simple fare in a casual vibe. The food: During the lockdown, Chef Zarębiński began making his own charcuterie, Rad Meats, with the hopes of making it easier to find quality sausages and all-natural, additive-free cured meats online; now you can try it here. Since almost 100% of everything is made in-house, the prices here are customer-friendly. A slice of sourdough will only set you back for B20. Try that with chef Klonowski’s grandma’s recipe of the Pasztet (Polish style baked pete, B140). Their sandwiches start at only B250 and you get things like sourdough with Polish ham, pickled cucumber, mayo and red onion. The cold brew here is light and chocolatey, served with a piece of dried prune (B130). There are also eight different kinds of cold press juice (B140/small, B180/large). Why we’d come back: While there are many cafes all over Bangkok to find solid cold cuts in the middle of Phrom Phong is not something that would come by easily in this city. Plus the casual vibe and comfortable seats mean you can just sit there all afternoon and work.

But at his new cafe in Thonglor, Waanthai, the illustrious chef takes on a new passion: Thai desserts.  The vibe:  right next to R.Haan, Waanthai is more casual in design, similar to photogenic cafes with plenty of natural light and inviting pastel palettes of light green and blue. Traditional Thai motifs like lai kanok are blended into the interior. The food: Sourcing regional ingredients across the country, chef Chumpol to serve authentic tastes from the yesteryear and elevate traditional Thai desserts through cutting-edge techniques and contemporary—and photogenic—presentation. Thai Mon Thong durian cheese cake (B180) is an answered prayer for durian devotees and a curse to those who despise it. Here, Chumpol uses whole flesh from durian and blends it to deliver the wonderfully creamy, custardy taste which doesn’t sacrifice any of its unique odors. Taro Custard Mille-Feuille (B180) ​​is a sly improvement on the classic mor gaeng, made of egg custard featuring multiple layers of chewiness.

There’s a different band playing Thai singalongs every night from 8:30-10pm, and afterward the DJ spins early 2000s hits. The space is perfect for those who party hungry. The food: For small bites, grab the easy-to-understand Asian dishes like salmon and avocado rolls (B420) or the black angus beef katsu sando that’s served with mustard seaweed and wasabi pickle (B690).

All steaks are cooked with coconut husk and served with two signature sauces with cucumber salad. The drinks: Signature cocktails are B320, and are easy-drinking but strong, like the Coconut 2.0 that mixes Havana Club 3 Year with Malibu, coconut puree, and pineapple juice.

620,Embassy Room - Catalan Cuisine,Restaurant,"The buzz: Catalan-born chef Ferran Tadeo moved to Bangkok from Hong Kong’s La Rambla to take over Park Hyatt’s Embassy Room after each day after the breakfast service is complete, turning it into the city’s newest Catalonian restaurant. Inspired by his heritage with Catalan cuisine and family recipes, Chef Tadeo is putting this uncommon style of food in the spotlight. The vibe: After breakfast is served, the kitchen and dining space get transformed, revealing a lot of details you wouldn't notice in the morning, like the beautifully tiled brown brick walls that make up much of the open kitchen’s structure. Bare tables get hidden under fancy white cloths and the breakfast counters get turned into a stage where chef Tadeo and his team start to put on a culinary show. The food: Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain that draws big influence from the West Mediterranean, so expect fresh ingredients with no-frills preparation and presentation. The prices for their tasting menu range from B1,400 (three courses), or B1,800 (four courses)—available for lunch only. For dinner, the prices start at B3,800 for seven courses or B4,700 for 10. One of the big highlights is the pop a la catalana, an octopus dish served with sofrito sauce and finished with picada (a pillar sauce of Catalan food). Another highlight is the pigeon and langoustine main course served with red wine sauce and paired with a 2017 bottle of red wine from Rioja—it really punctuates the whole experience as a special one. Pay attention to the two types of olive oil served here as well. They are both by Castillo de Canena, which has produced olive oil in the south of Spain since 1780. On several occasions, the brand's olive oil has scored an astounding 100/100 in the Flos Olei guide—basically the Michelin Guide for olive oil. Wine pairings are available and the restaurant claims to carry the biggest Spanish wine list in Bangkok—with 119 labels that took them over three months to source and put together.  Why we’d come back: While most fine-dining restaurants are only good to experience once or twice before getting stale, the team at Catalan Cuisine doesn’t overcomplicate the flavors or the techniques. It’s simplicity at its finest, presented well, and absolutely delicious.","A refined dining experience awaits on the 9th floor, where Catalan heritage is celebrated through authentic dishes.

621,Lobster Main Kitchen,Restaurant,"This review took place in September 2022 and is based on a visit to the restaurant without the restaurant's knowledge. For more on BK's review policy, click here. Finding good pasta priced in the low B300 range in Phrom Phong these days is becoming a rarity, which makes Lobster Main Kitchen’s reasonably priced menu all the more enticing.  Found hidden away in the back room of Aroon Cafe just a few minutes away from BTS Phrom Phong, the venue is the brainchild of Pariyapat “Kook” Liangsrisuk, who used to work at Angelini and L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, and Karn Liangsrisuk, a bartender from Dag. It’s a tiny space lined with bare concrete walls, rough surfaces, and colorful art pieces. Although the room nails the intimate vibe (better than many Bangkok restaurants), its tiny size means you can write off any hopes of a private conversation.  Lobster Main Kitchen promises good, hearty comfort food at reasonable prices. While many of the dishes tick those comfort boxes, our most recent visit highlighted how easily simple food can cross the line into mediocrity. Don’t expect to be blown away here, and some of the dishes can be downright disappointing.   Take the four cheese pizza (B340) for example, which came out on a pathetically dry and chewy dough that felt more like eating a pie than a pizza, while the cheese (which should be deliciously gooey and stringy) just crumbled off each bite like it had been sitting out in the open air for ages. Give the pizza here a wide berth.  While the pastas certainly fare better in the sense that they are edible, we found ourselves indifferent to the flavor profiles and preparations. The carbonara (B320), a staple of any good pasta restaurant, was forgettable and bland, while the tagliatelle aglio olio peperoncino with house-smoked beef (B550) tasted more like a pad kheemao than a proper AOP. It’s so spicy you’ll need a glug of expensive San Pellegrino and Acqua Panna water, which is all that’s available, to soothe your tongue after each bite.  Redemption was found in the beef tongue salad (B400), which was very well cooked and matched perfectly with the bed of rocket, tomatoes and balsamic glaze. The beef tongue was so good we assumed the beef tongue saffron risotto (B690) would be a sure hit, but that too was a disappointment when the risotto arrived at the table looking wetter than the streets of Bangkok in September. Even the delicious beef tongue, which was once again cooked to perfection, couldn’t uplift what felt like sloppy risotto soup. The desserts were a bit of a bright spot: comforting, sweet and simple. While the panna cotta (B180) won’t win any cooking competitions, we gladly gobbled it up. Same goes for the tiramisu (B200) with its inviting coffee aroma and subtle rum flavors—but we would have preferred the ladyfingers to be softer and mushier instead of crispy.  Although we like what Lobster Main Kitchen is going for, the preparation of the food, lack of inventiveness, and mediocre flavors firmly put this one in the “stuck in the neighborhood” category.","A hidden gem in Phrom Phong, this intimate spot offers hearty comfort food at reasonable prices. While some dishes like the beef tongue salad shine, others fall flat with bland flavors and lackluster preparation.

624,Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu,Restaurant,"The buzz: Everyone already knows about tonkatsu, the crunchy fried breaded pork cutlets popularized in Japan, but fewer know that you can swap the pork with juicy medium rare beef. Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu hailing from Japan specializes in just that. In fact, they’re the ones who popularized the beef cutlets trend in Japan. After quietly marketing through its Facebook page, the beef katsu chain has finally opened in an unlikely spot at Siam Center.  The vibe: Situated on the 2nd floor of Siam Center—the one sandwiched between Paragon and Discovery—Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu still sports a typical shophouse-esque atmosphere with only 16 seats. Due to its limited seating and, well, its location at the very epicenter of millennial crowds, the place is insanely packed for lunch and dinner, so hit it up in the afternoon.   The food: The cutlets at Gyukatsu are notable for their thinner panko bread crumbs and premium-quality cuts of beef, ranging from sirloin, chuck rail flap, tenderloin, tongue, and prized marbled wagyu—accompanied by a bed of sliced cabbage, hitomebore rice from Miyagi province and akadashi (a blend of soybean and rice) miso soup. The fun part, though, is the wide range of condiments you can pair with your pink beef, including wasabi, curry, sansho pepper, katsu, ponzu, and soft boiled shoyu egg. Order the chuck rail flap set (B490 regular; B580 large). For those who aren’t keen on the pink beef—we’re not judging—Gyukatsu provides a mini grilling pan where you can sear the beef to your liking. Be careful not to burn it, though. Why we’d come back: Dining in malls usually winds up in misery. But Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu provides an option where what you spend matches the quality of what you eat.

625,Kavee,Restaurant,"The buzz: Technically not a new contender on Bangkok’s fine dining scene, this swanky restaurant at IDEO Morph Sukhumvit 38 answers prayers for those fed up with predictable haute cuisine. Roughly translated as a “poem,” Kavee is the brainchild of chef Worathon “Tae” Udomchalotorn, an alumnus from the Culinary Institute of America and the original crew at chef Thitid “Ton” Tassanakajohn’s Le Du. Here, your meal finds chef Tae in full storytelling mode, alluding to new and old styles to reimagine the familiar tastes of Thai staples and underappreciated ingredients.   Photo: Kavee / Facebook. The vibe: Taking over a space from chef Andy Yang’s old Table 38, Kavee boasts a compact but simple setting with its mint-hued room, golden curved light chandelier, and massive wall mural of a horse—a nod to Yang’s old place. A large white counter takes centerstage and a gleaming open kitchen sits on one side.    The food: As the restaurant’s name suggests, the concepts at Kavee are metaphorical and figurative, as Tae uses classic Thai dishes as allusions and inspirations. Dubbed “Elegant Wilderness,” his new 10-course dining experience (B2,990) sets a stage for unsung ingredients that many deem unworthy and changes perceptions. Here, wild caught frogs, Thai pigeons and winged-ants (mae paeng) are at the heart of the menu. Our first course arrives with a crispy roll of trout roe. It greets you with a rich taste from coconut milk followed by a zesty tang of pineapple-yuzu gel. The same goes for the marinated tiger prawns in half-opened kaffir lime; the result is a fresh tang that pleases the tongue. Hoy khong (apple snail), meanwhile, is made into a bite-sized canape oozing piping-hot hazelnut mixed with spinach. We also loved the sun-dried scallop, served inside a smoked egg yolk pudding and topped with Thai rice porridge mixed with Northern perilla seeds.  Photo: Wild-caught frog. Porpor Leelasestaporn / BK Magazine. Tae’s main calling card, however, is the wild-caught frog where he draws references from Thai paddy fields. The frog legs are deep-fried but still plump inside with a bit of pink. The grilled avocado—along with the Vietnamese coriander, brussel sprouts, and watercress—all lend a refreshing note. Equally satisfying was his pigeon from Ang Thong province. To be honest, we originally had some doubts when we were told that the pigeons used were local—Sanam Luang’s pigeons are to blame. But whatever your notions are, this dish will blow you away. Reimagined from the French classic dish duck a l'orange, none of the pigeon is wasted: the breast is roasted on the crown, the legs deboned and slow-cooked, and the liver pulped to a silky puree—all of which is accompanied by sweet and sour cherry sauce and Srisaket’s volcanic black garlic. The full-blood wagyu chateaubriand (though a bit ordinary compared to the others) hints at Tae’s commitment to rare ingredients. Accompanying the juicy beef was tang chao, wild mushroom notable for its medicinal properties, providing a bitter crunch and a resemblance to Italian truffle.  Photo: Winged-ant mae paeng. Porpor Leelasestaporn / BK Magazine. Our course ends with three desserts. No, none of them were made from coconut milk, an all-too often lazy representation of Thai dessert. We’d definitely come back for a taste of his lychee Korean bingsu-like snow. Digging underneath, you’ll find seasonal fruits with champagne jelly offering an adult-taste to the kid’s menu. We also appreciate Tae’s bold take on Thai ants. Here, he takes Isan winged-ants (mae paeng) and powderizes them to lend malty flavors, a perfect combination to peanut butter caramel ice cream and the cocoa nib cracker on top. For those with a bold spirit, the staff is kind enough to let you pour the dried ants on top of the ice cream, an unexpectedly rich combination we never saw coming.  Why we’d come back: While Bangkok’s fine dining restaurants have become more accessible over the years—including those merely labeling themselves as such—Kavee offers a fresh, contemporary take without relying too much on imported ingredients and haute-quality produce. Sure, the place still has more room to grow but we are thrilled to see Tae’s next culinary verse.

626,Joy Dining Room,Restaurant,"This review took place in August 2022 and is based on a visit to the restaurant without the restaurant's knowledge. For more on BK's review policy, click here. Joy Dining Room opened as a grocery-slash-restaurant at Bambini Villa last year, and it wasn’t exactly in good shape right out of the gate. The then-restaurant was under siege from crusading influencers and self-righteous netizens after posting some controversial responses to online reviews on its Instagram’s stories (refresh your memory here). It’s been a year, and we believe that every restaurant—just like people—can change. In fact, we’d say this is a lovely dining experience for anyone who doesn’t care about the prices.   Let’s start with some redeeming qualities: Joy’s strong points aren’t all about food. People love this spot for its photogenic elegance. The room feels light and airy thanks to its wood paneling, warm lighting, and large pane window bathing the interior with natural light. The walls sport a gallery of soothing illustrations from Thai artist Suntur that ooze a style we found more than pleasant while dining.   Being half grocery also means there’s no question about the quality of products served at Joy, from seasonal ingredients like hotaru ika (Japanese spring firefly squid) to sea bass and lobster. But high-end ingredients are no guard against lackluster food.  There are two set menus, one for lunch (B1,500 per 4 courses) and the other for (B4,800/6 courses for two) The deep-fried chicken wings stuffed with chorizo and topped with sakura shrimp and sriracha mayo were underwhelming. The dish relied too heavily on the sauce, and if you’re going for fancy fried chicken, it should do better than Bon Chon. The next starter, prawn toast with shiso leaves—arriving piping hot and plump—was satisfactory but nothing special.    To be fair, there are some dishes we loved. The firefly squid on linguine radiated freshness. It's a delicious and simple combination of cured gray mullet roe and squid that offers well-balanced garlicky saltiness–save for the portion. We also appreciate the miso lamb rump served with harissa. Well portioned, succulent, and juicy. The skin is crispy, and when joined with the pungent harissa sauce, the dish was almost perfect. However, the maitake mushrooms on the dish came mushy and drenched in the liquid on the plate. We checked to see if they were soggy throughout. To our dismay, they were. The same goes for the wagyu tenderloin beef, which was seemingly truffle in name only.   Joy knocks it out of the park in terms of mood and tone. With its inviting atmosphere and a great wine list and even sake—both by bottle and glass—this place can dub as a casual business meeting spot when you’re in the neighborhood. But, this is Bangkok. We can easily point to other casual destinations of the same caliber with lower prices.  2.5 stars","A cozy space with elegant decor, this restaurant offers a blend of grocery and dining experiences.

627,Vilas,Restaurant,"The buzz: In a parallel universe, there is another Samrab Samrub Thai. Here, prominent Thai chef Prin Polsuk isn’t just an arbiter of Thai traditional taste and no longer pays heed to the country’s decades-old recipes. Instead, he adopts a more playful, modern approach dedicated to high-quality produce from across the globe. That restaurant in this universe is Vilas, Prin’s latest brainchild, where ancient cooking is stripped bare and reinterpreted with flair.  The vibe: Head to Mahanakhon Cube’s 2nd floor where you’ll spot an unassuming sign. Inside, the stunning arched entrance greets you before reaching a large automatic second door to reveal a spacious room enamored with sparse, earthy material and wood accents. The restaurant also boasts handcrafted products across the country to celebrate local craftsmanship—from white porcelain dinnerware to ceramic plates, and even the chairs and tables are custom-made. The food: Though not the head chef here himself, Prin passed his apron to a young Spanish chef, Pepe Dasi Jimenez, to helm the kitchen at Vilas. Skeptics may question the level of authenticity, but with his years under the tutelage of Thai establishments—Udon Thani’s Samuay and Sons, 100 Mahaseth, and 80/20 to name a few—Pepe ticks all the boxes for Thai cuisine (even though he admits he’s still still learning Thai to research more old recipes). His 12-course experience (B4,500) is inspired from King Rama V’s journey to the west, blending Thai traditional techniques with global ingredients. The course begins with kanom buang (Thai street-food crackers) paired with two sides: sweet horseshoe crab eggs influenced from Thai-Portuguese traditional dessert (thong yod) and Spanish salt-boiled fish liver seasoned with Thai chili paste and coconut shavings. Next is miang which foregos the usual leaf wrap for a crispy seaweed potato nest topped with Hokkaido sea urchin, shallots, roasted coconut, and tangy citron—a savory and full-flavored bite to gulp in one go. The nam prik is reimagined as a two-sided cracker made from a Thai gourd with hints of creamy coconut and subtly sweet, acidic snake fruit on one side and a strong punch from Japanese crab on the other. We love the choo chee, the thick red curry with charcoal grilled sea eel, influenced from Khun Ying Plian’s traditional cookbook. Here, the dish features Japanese eel and seasoned sweet fish sauce. The skins are crispy with hints of caramelized sweetness and the roasted coconut oil  bridges the flavors. The steamed egg with Japanese pink shrimp, meanwhile, arrives in an adorable egg bowl featuring hen eggs from Suphan Buri. Another fun dish is the pla som, featuring sweet fish ayu fermented in fish sauce, vinegar, and lime and then deep-fried with spicy Sriracha and coconut milk sauce.  The main course sees Australian beef curry made from scratch with turmeric, Vietnamese coriander, ginger, and chestnuts—a pungent, bold flavor. Those who can’t eat beef can opt for the pork cheek; we stole a bite from the bystander and guarantee it is worth it. The dish is paired with Japanese coconut rice topped with crunchy garlic and pickled vegetable sides. The course ends with Thai egg custard khanom morgaeng with ginkgo and honey-pickled persimmons, which reminds us of a Spanish flan, a nod to the chef’s hometown, while khanom khrok ice cream features coconut cream filling and chili-salt mango jelly.   Why we’d come back: With its more contemporary take on Thai cuisine, Vilas supplies us with a fresh perspective that blurs the line between conventional and modern Thai recipes, something we wouldn’t normally experience at Samrub Samrub Thai. As the menu takes on a more bold interpretation of the usual dishes, we’d love to see how this rare orchid vilas blooms in the future.","A modern twist on Thai cuisine awaits on the second floor of Mahanakhon Cube, featuring a spacious room adorned with handcrafted decor.

628,Taahra,Restaurant,"The buzz: Charcoal grilling is the heart and soul of Thai street food—from your regular moo satay and gai yang to sizzling pla phao and juicy kor moo yang. But one restaurant has set an ambitious goal for the Thai smoky grill arts. Nestled in an inconspicuous Charoenkrung Soi, Taahra reimagines Thai classic grilled menus and elevates them with flair, using Thai charcoal to cook.    The vibe: Unlike its quiet, unassuming facade, Taahra’s interior is bold and flashy. In fact, you could say that the space is an ode to taan (charcoal). Ebony black walls enclose the whole space, with a dusty texture resembling that of crackling charcoal. Be warned: don’t lean on them in a white shirt. A counter gathering 10 seats surrounds a live-fire grill space where chefs work their magic. If sitting nearby the grilling station isn’t your cup of coal, options are also available on the second floor.    The food: Though surprisingly looking more Western in both presentation and ingredients for Thai cuisine, dishes served at Taahra are still inherently and essentially Thai. “[Charcoal] has always been a part of our food culture, and countless dishes emerged from a cloud of woodsmoke,” head chef Pat-In “Knock” Promsawadi tells BK, saying that he wishes to revisit his roots and explore the possibilities of charcoal cooking.” His 13-course dining experience (B3,800) takes most all-time favorite charcoal dishes and enhances them with highly-elevated and bold presentations. During our last visit, we started off with three amuse bouches: taab waan (Thai chicken liver pate infused with Thai herbs and topped with tamarind gel, roasted rice, and pickled mustard seeds); Isaan raw meat koi, which sees dry-aged striploin, neatly sliced and placed atop crispy potato nest; and a yellow cracker that bursts with smoky tomato jaew mousse.  The first course arrived as grilled French oyster accompanied by a compressed cucumber sauce blended with chili pepper and coconut milk to replace the usual Thai seafood sauce. Next was stir-fried octopus served as a warm salad, using a bouncy, tender slow-cooked octopus. The French pigeon served alongside Thai banana blossom curry sauce was certainly a highlight; it was served rare and retained all of its earthy, gamey taste intact. Another fun dish—and possibly the black sheep of this menu—was the gai yang somtum (Thai papaya salad with grilled chicken). Instead of chicken, Knock opted for squab leg charcoal grilled to perfection and clad in black garlic powder for an umami flavor. It’s fun, but be forewarned your date might not like picking at a pigeon leg and eating it barehanded.  His main course, kao lao nuea (Thai-Chinese beef soup), was the most mind-boggling dish, in which each essential component of kao lao is deconstructed: Chinese kale stalks are found inside vegetable ravioli, alongside beef tenderloin, celery, and basil; on the top is golden garlic crisps. It’s a bold and daring take deserving of praise.  The course ended with toasted bread inspired by Yaowarat Instagram-worthy cream bread.  In case you’ve been traumatized by soggy or rigid breads you get on the street, fear not, as this is subtly sweet, soft, and jiggly—with a creamy strawberry custard and pink milk ice cream.   Why we’d come back: With its undaunted presentation and ambition to make Thai charcoal great again, patrons will find new perspective in a seemingly austere cooking technique we see daily. The chef also tells us the menu will be rotating seasonally, so we might stop by again to see what he brings to his live-fire cooking next.  By Porpor Leelasestaporn","A vibrant restaurant reinterprets traditional Thai grilled dishes with a bold twist.

629,Mott 32,Restaurant,"Mott 32 has been in the front of the Bangkok foodie brain for a while. Not just a world famous Chinese eatery with five other award-winning locations around the world, its fortunes have been tied to the long-awaited The Standard Hotel in Bangkok’s Mahanakhon. Well, it’s finally here—and booked out until at least next month. The vibe: There’s two sides to the second-floor Mott 32, the more glitzy dining area and more intimate dining rooms in the speakeasy style—dark, sexy, and sharp with hidden corridors. Sure, it’s got the gold tinge and front-of-shop bar, but there are plenty of dark corners to add ambience. It might not have the views of its Standard sister shop up at Ojo, but everywhere a Mott 32 lands, it brings style. The terrace isn’t quite open yet—but keep an eye out. The food: Dealing up the dimsum and duck is head chef Lee Man Sing via Hong Kong, and it wouldn’t be a Mott 32 without that special Canto touch, but you can expect more Chinese flavors than that on your plate (or bamboo steamer). Just talking dimsum, for example, you’re going to want to try the soft quail egg sui mai with pork and black truffle as well as the crispy sugar-coated bbq iberico pork bun—a simple but secret favorite. The juicy xiaolongbao here comes with a spicy kick. For a little something different there’s the fish maw jelly with goji berry and mint and a Chinese marinade sauce; it looks trippy, but it’s a savory little bite. Conversely, the fried abalone was a surprisingly simple addition and one we hope to see a lot more of in the future. For something heartier, you’ve got the smoked black cod and crab casserole, but let’s be honest: you’re here for the Peking duck. Not wanting to cause a riot, there are a lot of ways to do Peking duck. Here, you’ll find a very traditional apple wood roasted duck with crispy skin and just the right amount of fat; it’s the “signature Mott 32 cut” and that cut can come at the table—all part of the ambience and drama of Mott 32. As the experienced Peking ducker knows, skin goes with the sugar, and meat goes with the rest in the pancake. For an added bit of style, the duck","A stylish Chinese restaurant combines a vibrant, glitzy dining area with intimate speakeasy-style rooms.

630,Sarnies (Sukhumvit),Restaurant,"Previously operated as a pop-up while the construction was underway for three months, now Sukhumvit has a new, permanent Sarnies that you can hang around all day. You can expect a slate of the usual comfort breakfast options like miso kombu eggs Benedict served with aburi smoked salmon, sautéed leeks and shichimi togarashi (B400); or the sourdough pancakes served with apple miso caramel and house-made granola (B350). Your favorite sourdough pizza, leopard crust (pillowy dough with black char marks scattered over it like leopard print), also gets to stay on the menu for the entire day—a must-try here is the Land of Milk & Honey pizza with pepperoni, mozzarella, grana padano, stracciatella, and hot honey (B420). For dinner, see hearty Japanese-influenced dishes like hamaguri vongole: udon noodles with venus clams cooked in sake and a kombu butter broth (B450). Arguably the best dish on the menu, at least according to our last visits, is the black angus short rib, which is smoked for two-days and finished off on an open-fire grill (served with Japanese rice and some pickles on the side, B380/100g). You’ll be able to split one serving between three or four people.  To match the Japanese-influences on the menu, the interior  is decorated in minimal light-colored wood, creating a very clean, zen-like vibe for your work-from-cafe Zoom calls while musing over its expansive alcohol menu.","A cozy spot for all-day dining, the menu features comfort breakfast options and hearty Japanese-inspired dishes.

631,Acqua,Restaurant,"The buzz: Phuket’s  Somkid in Ploenchit so you can expect boogie, swank, and luxury. That said, the well-trained staff will make you feel at home. Unlike the Phuket location, the Bangkok one comes with all the space you need—60 seats to be exact. The restaurant also comes with two wine rooms—one for red wine and another for the other—as they need different temperatures. Chef Alessandro Frau is planning to open a project next door by the end of this year, too. The food: Right now, only an a la carte menu is available but stay tuned for a course menu. Chef Frau brought over his team from Phuket and mixed them with the Bangkok team, so you can expect the real Acqua tastes. Start with the refreshing ceviche of scallops and Gillardeau oysters with marinated fish eggs B1,500 (three pieces)—good to cleanse your palate. Our personal favorites are the Sardinian smoked eel served with pickled vegetables, sweet and sour white balsamic vinegar sauce, and grilled bread topped with mozzarella cheese and caviar on the side (B750). The flavor combination was just right. Another is the roasted quail, served on top of pan-fried foie gras, lentils glazed with quail sauce, and deep-fried crispy crispy quail wings for you to snack on (B1,350). And, if you’re not used to eating tiny quail wings, it’s quite a treat.  Why we’d come back: Even if the prices are a little steep—though understandable for Ploenchit—to be dining here on a regular basis, the service, quality,and massive wine list make the whole experience worth it, and we’d definitely come back for a special occasion.","A luxurious restaurant in Ploenchit, it offers a spacious dining area with exceptional service.

632,Koji-delic,Restaurant,"The buzz: Masterchef Thailand Season  31, Koji-delic sports a cool, calm, collected glasshouse encasing a small dining area seating up to 8 patrons. Following modern Nordic looks, the space is pure functionality: brown wood furniture contrasted with naked cement walls. There’s also a small garden outside where Peter grows most of the greenery used for cooking. The food: Like the name suggests, koji is the star concept here. Every course has been inspired by and interwoven with Japanese and Nordic techniques to bring out the tangy delights through fermented metamorphosis. The menu follows a 10-course experience (B3,500) where Peter and his crew source ingredients from local farmers and fishers for his experimental courses. The first course arrives as a flaxseed cracker, which sees Chiang Rai flaxseed in a crispy cracker topped with seaweed emulsion, koji oil, fermented peach, and kimchi powder—though without any traces of meat, it’s a jam-packed with umami and flavor. Next is giant trevally sourced from Phuket where local fishers prepare it with the Japanese ikejime technique. The fresh plump dices of trevally are accompanied by homemade pickled cucumber and buttermilk to enhance the flavor. Another dish with heavy influence from Japan is the big reef squid. Though pared-back in presentation, the dish is, in fact, a traditional Japanese miso in disguise—complete with eggplant miso puree, homemade brine bread, leek, and red onion, all topped with mushroom dashi foam and fermented tomato powder. After the main course, there’s the pre-dessert we really like: the pink guava ice cream—think Japanese multi-layered parfait where each layer contains unique flavors, starting off with the tangy yuzu jelly, white peach ice cream, pink guava granita, and ending with yuzu milk foam topped with koji pink powder. The main dessert, meanwhile, is koji ice cream, a mixture of thick mascarpone cheese and koji-infused ice cream with liquored orange and bitter orange caramel. Digging underneath, you’ll find a brown sugar biscuit soaked with wild honey.  Why we’d come back: Though Bangkok has become a playground for Nordic cuisine following the arrival of Bjorn Frantzen’s first Swedish outpost in Bangkok, there are few serious restaurants that really focus on the cuisine. Koji-delic, despite being a new contender to the scene, shows a kind of determination which clearly deserves more spotlights and support.

633,Kimi Sushi Bar,Restaurant,"The buzz: Bangkok is spoiled for omakase options, but most aim for upmarket and expensive. Kimi Sushi Bar, however, offers a casual outdoor omakase dining experience with affordable prices—perfect for first-timers. The vibe: The off-beat  49 offers a quiet, casual space with an outdoor seating area, and Kimi is an ideal addition to the space. Located outdoors by the main stairs (the ones that go up to La Bottega), the pop-up wooden hut-like offers six seats at the counter for food and a few other seating options for drinking. If it rains, you’ll still be protected but you'll definitely get some sprinkles in a downpour, making it super cozy. Just keep drinking their 10-label rotating natural wines and you won’t mind a bit of rain. The food: Don’t let the super casual setting fool you into thinking that they aren’t serious about their food. The omakase here is served in Edomae style, a process-heavy style with roots in the Edo period—back when the lack of refrigeration caused a reliance on cooking techniques in aging, fermentation, and more. There are three rounds of omakase and six seats per round: 4pm, 6pm, and 7:30pm. It's B2,099 for around 15 courses. For this price, some of the highlights we enjoyed included the torched kinmedai (alfonsino), bringing out the soft smokiness nicely, and the ankimo, which is monkfish liver served with a tiny dollop of wasabi to cut through the fattiness. If you’re an uni-lover, you’ll also get a taste of that at this price.Why we’d come back: Thonglor has many options for restaurants and bars, but we haven’t found one that offers a super casual, fun, friendly vibe like Kimi Sushi.

634,Villa Frantzén,Restaurant,"The buzz: Swedish chef Björn Frantzén—the three-star Michelin chef behind the eponymous restaurant empire the Frantzén Group—has graced Bangkok with his first outpost in Thailand, Villa Frantzén, upending the Nordic dining scene in Bangkok.  The decor: Taking over the space of a two-storey house on Soi Yen Akat and converting it into two Nordic-style villas, Villa Frantzén is complete with a lush green garden and little corner staff joke could be used as a proposal nook. The space is separated into two different villas: one for the cocktail lounge—a nod to Frantzén’s original establishment—and the other for the restaurant. Stepping inside, you’re greeted by a massive open kitchen full of staff working their magic. Those wanting for more privacy can book private dining rooms upstairs with the added benefit of a balcony view.   The food: The food is helmed by head chef Martin Enström. His 5-course tasting menu (B3,500) sees modern Nordic cuisine with a touch of Asian influence. The fun part is that you can design your own course as each tasting menu has three available options, so if you happen to have more than two friends, it’s highly recommended to bring them along to experience his courses to the fullest. Our first course arrives as veal tartare and smoked parsley, an excellent starter where thick, creamy creme fraiche mixes with bright, crunchy vendace roe and melon radish. Next is cauliflower chawanmushi and morels, a steamed egg custard in yeasted mushroom tea, lime, toasted hay oil, lemon thyme, and split peas. Though personally not a big fan of vegetables, we find their pumpkin and frozen truffle butter very well-executed, seeing broccoli topped with Swedish Vasterbotten cheese, pumpkin seed oil, and spinach. The main course of ox cheeks and caramelized onion veloute is delightful; the cheeks are soft and buttery and require almost no effort to cut; the brussel sprouts, parsley, and liquorice that accompany the dish all serve as great accompaniments. The course ends with the dessert: a large chocolate sphere encasing Frantzen’s signature smoked ice cream with toasted pecans, bitter cacao nibs, tar syrup, and salted fudge with cloves. The other interesting option is the Szechuan pepper ice cream with fiery kicks from mala pepper. If five courses don’t satisfy your cravings, there are supplemental servings, including the Oyster 63.4c (B250), Frantzen’s signature poached oysters topped with spicy pumpkin condiment, smoked cream, finger lime, and sea buckthorn oil. The drinks: The restaurant has two different pairings: wine (B1,900 for five glasses) and a non-alcoholic pairing (B1,500 for 5 glasses). Though we’d normally love to choose the wine pairing, we highly recommend you opt for their fermented juice and kombucha. Among our favorites is their roasted red rice and cloudberry, reminiscent of rice milk. After you finish the menu, walk to their bar lounge and try some of their signature cocktails. Most of the signatures take a nod from Nordic cuisine with Asian ingredients. The Chlorophyll Highball (B430), for example, arrives as an unassuming translucent drink, a blend of dry gin, mezcal blanco, sea buckthorn water, and pear shrub. Sipping the floating green drops, however, will amaze: gas-infused sichuan mala. The Berries and Cream (B420) sees red-berry cordial, violette, and verjus topped with cream cheese and egg white—a dessert in a glass to satisfy any sweet tooth.  Why we’d come back: As each of their dining experiences has three different options, you might need to come here at least once more to experience everything. Though the restaurant’s bookings are quite competitive, their bar is open for walk-in visitors, so feel free to stop by.

635,Buenazo,Restaurant,"The buzz: The march of Peruvian cuisine has been unstoppable this year. Following the opening of Anantara Siam’s Japanese-Peruvian restaurant Guilty, Bangkok has welcomed another Peruvian-focused eatery, Buenazo, at The Commons Thonglor.  The vibe: Though the place looks a bit boxy—with a maximum capacity of around 10 seats encasing the open-kitchen—there’s something larger than life to this cozy eatery. Each wooden plank they use is, in fact, taken from sunken boats purchased from fishers in Phetchaburi, reflecting Buenazo’s mission for sustainability and social responsibility.   The food: The man behind the kitchen is Peruvian chef Santiago Fernandez, who was initially part of Na Project’s urban refugees kitchen—a collaborative space where immigrant families from various ethnic backgrounds cook food to raise social awareness. Growing up in Lima, Peru, Fernandez explains that even among Peruvians, the cuisine is uniquely diverse. “So, I want you to have a taste of my version of Peruvian dishes,” he tells BK Magazine. We started off with his Classico Ceviche (B365) local sea bass marinated in citrus leche de tiger, which is quite sparklingly fresh. Aki Amarillo Mixto Ceviches (B395), meanwhile, sees bright yellow Peruvian chili paste with the addition of plump shrimp and squid. There’s also Arroz Verde De Chicken (B365) which Fernandez comically describes as Peruvian khao mun gai, topped with Huancaina sauce. Another fun dish is Lomo Saltado (B435), a traditional Peruvian stir-fried tenderloin beef with onions and tomatoes with flavors that somehow remind us of Chinese sweet-and-sour stir fry. It’s hard to miss their beef heart skewer anticuchos (B195); though expensive, it’s something we would be willing to go back for.            Why we’d come back: As we’d love to see this cuisine grow in Bangkok’s food scene, we might stop by the Commons Thonglor more often. Chef Fernandez also tells us that Na Project will bring some of their future chef collaborations here as well, so stay tuned.","A cozy eatery focuses on sustainable Peruvian cuisine, showcasing unique dishes crafted by chef Santiago Fernandez.

DJs bring the heat and there’s plenty of floor space to mingle by the busy bar. With a photogenic abacus wall, the atmosphere is sharp, well-lit, and sweet—literally; there’s a vintage-style candy room that’s selfie central for the Thai kids. The food: Now, this is where things get interesting: classic Chinese and Southeast Asian dishes made with inventive flair. On the dim sum menu, Lily’s Purse (B160) is a three-flavor dumpling of shrimp, black truffle, and spinach; for the purist, grab the ha gao (B125) and shoo mai (B125). The bao, numbered one through six, run the gamut—Hong Kong, Hainan, Indonesia—but we highly recommend the Bao #5 (B250), Vietnamese-style beef with onion, ginger, and a “Sriracha-Hoisin” dark bean chili sauce on a fluffy white bao. For a starter, the must try is the poached “larb style” sea bass (B240) or heartier chow mein (B170), and for something properly Thai, share the extra creamy khao soi (B260). If you’re a party of proper carnivores, the absolute must-try is the tomahawk (B260/100g) of grilled Australian black angus with three sides. Speaking of, don’t forget your greens; you get some proper “wok hay” on your veggies here. For dessert, there's a chocolate tart (B250) with chocolate chili ganache, sour cream cheese, and salted caramel, but for something a little less sweet and more creative there’s Lily’s Mango Sticky Rice, featuring mango, sticky rice berry, and coconut cream with a mango sorbet (B250). The drinks: You’ll find classic but creative cocktails. The Thai negroni (B280) sticks out as a favorite, mixing Saneha gin with Campari, Chinese five spice, and 1757 rosso; the refreshingly tart Chaophraya (B260) is Phraya rum, agave, lime, chili, and ginger. But there are also delightfully simple drinks to be had, like the Coconut Mojito (B230) and the Mek","A stylish venue on Soi 11, the atmosphere pulses with energy thanks to lively DJs and a spacious bar.

637,Guilty,Restaurant,"The buzz: Besides Above Eleven, which has been providing us with Peruvian-Japanese bites for years, Bangkok doesn’t have many options from this part of the world, as opposed to Mexican food. So, the addition of this new Peruvian place is a welcome one. The vibe: Forget the outdated image that hotel dining is all proper and fancy. Here, they randomly bring out “surprise shots” and you can even get up and dance to Latin American music between the tables. The food: Leading the kitchen is the lively and easy-going Venezuelan-Colombian chef Carlos Rodriguez who first came to Thailand in 2015 and is a familiar face on the Bangkok restaurant scene, having worked at Gaggan and Penthouse Bar and Grill at the Park Hyatt Bangkok to name a few. Serving Peruvian Nikkei (Peruvian ingredients molded by Japanese techniques), the quality of the fish and beef here is on par with leading Japanese restaurants around Bangkok. If you’re unfamiliar with Peruvian cuisine, expect a mouthful of dishes like the jicama mango salad (B450)—sour, fresh, with sweet mango to balance it. There’s also the Toda La Vida Ceviche (B800, hamachi, yellow tiger milk, crispy corn, and coriander). Another seafood dish we really love is the kamado grilled Hokkaido scallops (B1,050) served with crunchy quinoa crust, mirin, yellow pepper sauce and aji limo (lemon drop chili). For protein, you can't miss the Busyu wagyu A5 from Saitama Prefecture, Tokyo, cooked on Himalayan salt stone (B25/g, average serving between 70-250g). The highlight of this dish is the underrated rocket and asparagus salad on the side, dressed in ponzu sauce to cut through the fatty meat. The drinks: Just like the food, the cocktails are on the Latin America theme. If you’ve had a long day at work packed with meetings, grab the El Bandito (B450) which uses Alipus mezcal mixed with thyme, pink pepper tincture with pulque syrup, and a whole egg. This sweet, earthy glass comes at 33% ABV, so be careful! Not that much of a hardcore drinker? Grab the Cactus Scape No.1 (B320, El Jimador Blanco tequila, pineapple, agave, and adobo spice mix) for something tropical and easy to start. The crowd: The after-work crowd looking for a place they can unwind, have fun, and laugh out loud in a casual setting. Why we’d come back: While Bangkok is packed with Mexican food, it’s not often we come across decent Peruvian cuisine. Plus, the vibe is fun and easy-going, giving hotel dining a whole new different atmosphere.","A lively restaurant offering a unique blend of Peruvian and Japanese flavors, led by chef Carlos Rodriguez.

638,Fishmonger,Restaurant,"The buzz: Located inside Banthat Thong’s latest GalieOasis green space is the new seafood eatery Fishmonger. They're on a mission to give Thai fish the spotlight with crowd-pleasing fish and chip menus. Owner Ploypapat Ariyakamolrat partners with Lanta Pla Thai, a fish caterer based in Koh Lanta, to source less familiar fish from local fishermen and prepares them with advanced techniques like Japanese ikejime and shinkeijime, allowing them to earn more money with less common fish.  The decor: This place might remind you of one of those typical fast food joints with the usual cashier counter, massive menu screen with infographic details, and a blackboard showcasing the catch of the day where you can swap ingredients. There are only three tables inside, but they also have plenty of outdoor seating, which is great considering the lush green space. The food: There are three types of fish available: one is the standard fish (B195, including barracuda, painted sweetlips, and black kingfish), the premium options (B260) (grouper and John snapper), and the catch of the day sourced from Koh Lanta. “Less mainstream species usually go unrecognized by the middlemen since they don’t want to take the risk of buying them,” Walaiporn Chudokmai from Koh Lanta Pla Thai explains. “These wild-caught species, therefore, usually need to be sold at extremely low prices and we want to change that.” On our recent visit, we tried their fish and chips made from pink-ear emperor fish (B195), which we’d give full marks for frying. Its golden shell came without the usual heavy feel you get from fish and chips, and the fish itself was moist and meaty. Another crowd pleaser is the Fish Burger (B195), with a wonderfully light beer-battered barracuda that packs a punch. If you’re a health-conscious eater, try their kamong prao (giant trevally) grilled salad (B260) instead. Why we’d come back: Thai fish are really under-appreciated for what they are actually worth. Change is not easy, we know, but this place is letting you know that Thai fish are more than just sea bass and snapper—a lecture that comes with delicious notes.

639,North,Restaurant,"The buzz: True, Bangkok has never suffered from a shortage of Northern food—you’ll find plenty of khao soi places on one soi alone. But it’s a different story when we think about fine dining. Following Phaya Thai’s Lanna-focused fine-dining Maze, North promises authentic northern flavors and a novel taste of the old The decor: The restaurant takes over a colonial-style house that once belonged to ML Nuam Snidvong and retains most of its former glory, complete with lush green garden. Several hints and references to Lanna’s heritage are writ large in North’s design—think yee peng (traditional Northern floating paper lanterns over the ceiling) and triangular blinds that draw reference from khanom jok (Northern-style sweet dough pyramid). For more privacy, there are two private dining rooms available with balcony views. The food: At North, you’ll find several lesser known ingredients from Northern Thai provinces. In this 9-course dining experience (B2,888), you start off with a jackfruit mousse tart and featherback fish larb with an aromatic kick from Lanna’s staple makwaen spice. The fun of these two amuse bouches is that the white powder inside the box is not just for show: you can add this rice powder on top of either dish for crunchy flavor and to mitigate the spiciness—quite thoughtful. Next is Khao Som, Tai Yai’s rice braised in tomato broth—hence the “orange” part of the name. The rice is topped with crab paste and sandwiched between a Thai rice cracker and hollandaise sauce. Equally fun is the French duck breast smoked with Fleur du Nord tea served alongside with Chiang Mai’s wild fruit jelly makiang and galangal chili sauce. The course is then buffered with Phulae pineapple sorbet topped with spherized wild longan honey and rice crackers. We also love the spin on khao soi; the chef swaps the usual noodles for angel hair spaghetti and serves it with grilled river prawn and herbal sauces. The most intriguing part is their traditional set menu dubbed “Khan Toke North'' filled with Northern specialties in a refillable, all-you-can-eat feast, including beef shank hanglay curry, sauteed Chiang Dao vegetables with eggs; kurobuta sai oua; and Northern chili dip with free range chicken. The dessert menu is filled with regional ingredients including the musk melon cream mousse with pandan tulle with a flavor reminiscent of lod chong served alongside green bean jelly from Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai strawberry sorbet.  Why we’d come back: North has been open since December last year and is still evolving. With the old charms of yesteryear and a commitment to bringing lesser known ingredients from the North to the plate, we’d say there’s more to expect from this new addition to Bangkok’s culinary scene.  By Porpor Leelasestaporn   Photo: Porpor Leelasestaporn / BK Magazine","A colonial-style house sets the stage for a fine dining experience showcasing authentic Northern Thai flavors.

640,Jardin Du Boeuf,Restaurant,"The buzz: This new steak place is the latest creation by Chef Deepanker Khosla of Haoma. Introducing a new way to enjoy your food by bringing you closer to nature and ethically sourced food and ingredients, while being aware of food waste. The vibe: It has been a while since we’ve had anything cool in Rama 9 and this restaurant is a gamechanger. Offering spacious, comfortable seating at Somerset Hotel, don’t be put off by the big play gold tones (lighting, utensils), or the French name you can’t pronounce, the place is very friendly and invites you to have fun, drink, and get loud with your friends. At one corner there’s a big painting of former R&B singer-turned-entrepreneur Rihanna—who some at the table saw as Beyonce, making for a great dinner debate. The food: Leading the kitchen team is Chef Don Sujith, previously Restaurant Age at Anantara Layan Phuket. The beef here is from a “happy cattle”, family-run farm sourced mostly from locals, and the kitchen team dry-ages the meat themselves. The seafood is ethically line-caught and the greens are from small organic farms. Start your dinner with Steak Fries (B350) that will make you forget about any other steak and fries you’ve ever had, serving potato Mille-Feuille cooked in duck fat on beef and topped with English mustard. Another must-try starter is the Burnt Leeks (B490), just as described: leeks cooked inside an open wood fire until the outside is slightly burned, then dressed with hazelnuts, caper butter, and beef fat. Now onto the mains. Of course you have to try the Thai beef steak, and you have three options: grass-fed, wagyu, and angus, with three different cuts. Prices start at B990 for 250g of grass-fed striploin. If you want something other than beef, try their Charred Tiger Prawns (B850) served with sambal. Why we’d come back: Thai beef is just so underrated. We would gladly travel to Rama 9, even on a rainy day, just to eat more of their grass-fed dry-aged steak.","A vibrant steakhouse in Rama 9, this restaurant emphasizes ethically sourced ingredients and a lively atmosphere perfect for gatherings.

641,Dukedon,Restaurant,"Nestled in the unusual foodie location of Soi Inthamara 31, Dukedon takes pla duk (Thai catfish) away from the usual somtum stalls and puts them into the spotlight.  When we describe it as hidden and down-to-earth, we mean it. In fact, the place blends in with other houses on the same soi; the only giveaway is the signpost in front of the house.  We’re not talking about regular grilled pla duk here. Three chefs—Prutkumpond “Sarm” Salak, Tachatam “Ton” Saekow, and Kittinan “Kit” Saratantiphong—specialize in both shinkeijime and ikejime (Japanese methods for preserving fresh umami flavors by cutting blood vessels and paralyzing the fish). The fish is then dry-aged for four to five days before being served.  On our last visit, we tried duke don (B219), a bowl of rice served with freshly-grilled catfish finished with kabayaki-style glaze lending a subtly sweet coating to the crispy skins. Equally delightful was pla mor don (B249), a twist on Thai climbing perch fish where chefs remove all those annoying bones and torch it to perfection.  Since the three of them have to source the fish by themselves—not to mention the dry-aging process—it’s highly recommended to book your pla duk beforehand.       Photo: Porpor Leelasestaporn / BK Magazine.","A hidden gem in Soi Inthamara 31, this restaurant focuses on elevating pla duk with expert techniques from three skilled chefs.

The seed of their recent collaboration sprouted into Thailand’s first cacao-centric bistro, 31 Degrees, where they add chocolate and cacao beans into everything.  The vibe: At first glance from the outside, 31 Degrees sports a look similar to typical Bangkok cafes with light-wood accented furniture. But inside, you can see the encased glass room where chefs work their magic. Head up to the second floor for more privacy.  The food: Bocuse d’Or is basically an Olympics for cooking, so every dish is meticulously prepared and crafted to levels comparable to a competition. Start off with the organic beetroot carpaccio (B290) topped with soothing potato cream; the vinegar dressing lends a refreshing tang buffered by bitter cacao crumbles. If you want something more filling, go for their double filet crispy fish (B340), which arrives in an open-sandwich accompanied by shallots marinated in cacao juice to add a subtle sweetness. The star here, however, is the oven-roasted free-range baby chicken (B490) served alongside creamy polenta and mushrooms, in which the chef pours intensely rich Chumphon chocolate juice. Chocoholics should also try their “Ultimate Chocolate,” the chocolate tart filled with chewy chunks of brownies, roasted almond, and cacao espuma foam, all of which are covered with the layers of cacao nibs French tuile and topped with sorbet. Arriving there early? Try Devil May Cry (B260), a ham and cheese muffin stuffed with soft-boiled eggs served with Chanthaburi chocolate barbeque sauce. The drink: Fans of Kad Kokoa should know how decadent their chocolate drinks can be, and yet they still source their own single origin beans from growers across the kingdom. Their new signature drinks, however, are more bold and fresh in both concept and presentation. Go for Cacao Cinema (B170), an espresso-blend featuring Chumphon cacao beans, or Cacao Red Berry (B170) made with homemade berry puree and frothy milk. They also whip up cacao cocktails, including Venti Elixir (B350) (gin infused chocolate from Prachuap Khriri Khan, Venti Amaro, bitters, and coconut essence) and Meet Me @31c (B320), a vodka-based cocktail infused with Chiangmai chocolate, toffee nut, cacao, and lemon juice, all topped with foam.  Why we’d come back: We have been visiting them since day one; everytime we go, the menu evolves.

Stepping outside, there are a few seats on the balcony overlooking extended staircases, perfect for the days Phuket’s gives us some mercy.   Samut, meaning “ocean” in Thai, makes a clear commitment to bring ingredients from Thailand’s coastlines to the table. And it’s not just Phuket; chef Ton partners with Thai fishermen in Prachuap Khiri Khan, Phang Nga, Chumphon, Surat Thani, and more for the seafood delicacies for his eight-course dining experience (B2,690).  Buare goon yang (Southern-style prawns with crispy polyscales leaf).

Some are pleasant combinations but others are rather combative in terms of flavor. We loved pla gor lae the coral fish grilled in a coconut barbecue sauce that adds a sweet tang from pickled chili, and the six-hour-braised murex snail was soft and fresh with its crunchy betel leaf.

646,Montagne,Restaurant,"Bangkok is in no danger of running out of ice cream parlors, but this one from chef Bhupar “Poon” Choonharas caught our attention.   After winning Thailand’s first Sweet Chef competition in 2018, Poon trained in France under ice cream master Emmanuel Ryon who received the Meilleur Ouvrier de France title for ice cream making in 2000. When he came back to Bangkok, Poon compressed his knowledge into the dainty Montagne on Rama 3.  “Like any other confectionery, ice cream deserves its own stage and presentation. I believe there are plenty of ways we can all enjoy our ice cream,” Poon tells BK Magazine.  You’ll find a mix of both traditional and unusual flavors (starting B80 to B120): Fleur de Benjamas (white chrysanthemum, honey, and yogurt sorbet), Ananas Shiso (pineapple and shiso sorbet), and Carotte Orange Gingembre (carrot, orange, and ginger sorbet).   Aside from bold flavors at the counter, Poon has a few special ice cream creations. Mille Feuille (B160), for example, reimagines the classic French confectionery with each component arranged into a single scoop; inside are delicate, crispy caramel layers and a flaky filo pastry on top.   His artisan ice cream also accompanies his plated desserts, usually reserved for those who book beforehand. His Vacherin (B330) features vanilla ice cream and raspberry sorbet topped with a meringue plate arranged with fresh raspberries and edible flowers. We also loved Choux à la Noisette (B270), featuring hazelnut ice cream and creamy chocolate inside the crispy choux.   There’s no alcohol for now, but the mocktails are overseen by the talented Supawit “Palm” Muttarattana himself. The Light Beaujolais (B140) features lightly-roasted barley tea with a mixture of roselle, cranberry, raspberry syrup; Saint Tropez Time (B160) sees a blend of clarified milk, coconut juice, passion fruit, and pineapples.","A charming ice cream parlor showcases unique flavors crafted by chef Bhupar Choonharas, who trained under a French master.

647,Tempered,Restaurant,"Named after the technique used to achieve chocolate’s smooth, shiny finish, Tempered is a serious new contender on Bangkok’s cacao scene, all started from the humble beginnings of one passion-driven couple.  “It all began with this tiny drum roaster,” Kris Suteerachai, the owner of Tempered tells BK Magazine while displaying the first chocolate refiner he bought at the start of his cacao journey. The machine was only capable of grinding  Ruamrudee with a gleaming glass-to-ceiling windows overlooking the lush greenery from the house across the street.   Recognizing that some customers may not be familiar with Thai chocolate, the couple also make an effort to introduce patrons to the Kingdom’s cacao culture. Their single chocolate drink (B150) menu sources cacao beans from provinces across the country. On our last visit, their single-origin chocolate from Phatthalung was thick, rich, and dark—a decadent mugful with a somewhat fruity and nutty aftertaste. Coffee aficionados will want to opt for their Chocolate Dirty (B160).  Fern, who has been practicing her pastry skills, oversees the bakery menu. Her almond croissant (B140) has light, crispy layers oozing almond cream. Those who want something more filling can go for her generously-sized ham and cheese croissant (B165). Her proudest creation, and our favorite, is Not a PBJ (B215), which combines Fern’s three favorite sweet treats: peanut butter, jam, and a chocolate brownie made from the same cacao beans as the speed bar. We loved the soft, fresh, croissant-like texture that goes well with the peanut butter frosting, accompanied by a fresh tang from the jam-filled chocolate brownies.   The couple, however, don’t plan to stop here. Eventually, Tempered will open its slow bar on the third floor to introduce customers to more geographically diverse cacao beans.","A cozy café celebrates Thai cacao culture with rich single-origin chocolate drinks and delectable pastries. Specialty items include the almond croissant and the unique Not a PBJ dessert, showcasing a blend of flavors.

648,Mother,Restaurant,"The buzz: Chefs Khun Apis and Koranat “Tle” Robkob have partnered for this casual fine dining restaurant in Charoenkrung for an intimate, straightforward celebration of local Thai ingredients.  The vibe: Located next to hip coffee shop La Cabra, Mother sports an earthy interior inspired by mother nature. Inside this two-storey shophouse, natural light slips through wooden ceilings, offering a fun play of light and shadow. Entering the large doorway, you’re greeted by light-wood furniture and an open plan kitchen where Tle works his magic. However, climbing the wooden staircase, the second floor bar efuses a darker, more mysterious vibe. The food: Fine-dining aficionados will expect a progressive presentation of dishes, but you won’t find that here. The 10-course dining menu (B2,890) sports a straightforward, thoughtful look to squeeze the essence from each ingredient. We loved the mushroom which arrived in three humble fungi packages: cold-infused dice cut, tart, and tea. Despite their plain appearance, Tle’s three “mushketeers” left us stunned. Similarly, the yum nuea (beef tartare) saw three bites in one course: caramelized khao mak (fermented sweet rice) and salted fish wrapped inside a confit kale leaf, a spoonful of Chiang Rai wild honey, and beef tartare and rice cracker—boasting a texture that reminded us of khao kreab wow—topped with salmon fish roe. The Gillardeau oysters meanwhile are charcoal grilled on the shell and topped with a fresh gooseberry sorbet, a fresh tang to replace the usual Thai seafood sauce. The Tapi river prawns are sourced from Surat Thani province and no part is wasted; the fat from the head is squeezed and seared with kani miso for aioli sauce and the salt-like powder is made from dehydrated prawn shells for a natural saltiness. The fresh catch of the day, dubbed Andaman, is grilled golden snapper cloaked with Japanese ponzu sauce served alongside warm fish bone and oyster broth. For his duck umeshu, Tle—instead of choosing Cherry ducks like most fine-dining establishments in Bangkok—opts for French barbary ducks from Rayong for a less gamey taste. The duck is dry-aged and cold-smoked with Japanese plum liqueur and served with fried lotus roots pickled with paprika and ma kwaen, which has a spicy profile similar to the numbing flavors of Chinese mala. Tle’s kaeng kua pu (Thai crab curry) is made from scratch with creative twists. Rather than in the curry paste, Tle makes fingerroot into sweet candies and serves the whole bowl with kani miso rice mixed with Chaiyaphum crab tomalley. The highlight, however, was the Nhong Khai wagyu, a 30-day dry aged beef accompanied by barley miso sauce and sweet roasted cauliflower marinated in sweet shoyu and chili jam. Dessert is choux with slow-cooked banana cream mousse, a decadent treat with a hidden exotic specialty: the innocent-looking crispy crumbles on the top of the mousse are actually rod duan (bamboo caterpillars). Equally thoughtful was toasted rice ice cream served with crispy smoked bacon and meringue made from fermented Thai sweet rice.  Why we’d come back: Though Thai fine-dining concepts are not new to Bangkok’s food scene, we still want to take a moment to appreciate these thoughtful, passionate young chefs trying to churn out new things in the city that never stops. The way that Tle and Khun have committed to bringing Thai ingredients to the table is commendable. As they change their menu seasonally—and plan to open a full-fledged bar above—we won’t hesitate to stop by again.

649,Thaipas,Bar,"After successfully bringing their mantis shrimp to Ruamrudee Soi 20 from Rayong, Kang Banphe is branching out their seafood specialties to this tastefully twee Thai-Spanish tapas bar at Thonglor’s Seen Space 13, dubbed Thaipas.  Like its first establishment in Bangkok, Thaipas excels in simplicity and boasts local produce and wild-caught seafood, offering arguably the most affordable range of small bites and fulsome sharing plates in the area.  Try the croquettes (B180/2 pieces) in which chef Anupa “James” Kavindrakolvajira sources fresh wild mantis prawns and stuffs them inside these crispy and savory fillings. Or, you can order the duck liver pate baguettes (B95/4 pieces) topped with freshmade blackberry jam—a surprising favorite—to share.  During our visit, James brought out his 20-hour dry-aged sea bass to the kitchen counter and slowly sliced away the fresh from its bones before pouring Peruvian citrus marinade leche de tigre on top. The result was a refreshing, plump sea bass ceviche (B180) with a satisfyingly bouncy texture. Boiled wingshell with maldon salt (B120), meanwhile, saw hoy chak teen served with lemon and Thai spicy seafood sauce.  The highlight, however, is a large sharing pan of arroz negre, or black paella (B420), tinted black with squid ink and accompanied by a wide range of seafood—think hefty Kang Banphe’s mantis shrimp, fresh prawns, and clams.  Wash it all down their kluay tak (Rayong’s dried banana) ice cream (B75) featuring tiny bits of caramelized banana in every bite, a perfect combination to their creamy caramel flan (B120). Drink-wise, Thaipas also offers wines by glass, including Follador Prosccco (B150), Villa Martina Pinot Grigio (B220), and Penfolds Max’s Chardonnay (B250); and a fancy Dom Perignon will run up to B18,500. Thaipas also doubles as a seafood noodle shop at noon, so stop by early to taste their Michelin-plate recognized mantis shrimp or wait until 5.30pm to have fun with these new bites.","A tastefully designed Thai-Spanish tapas bar offers a delightful array of seafood specialties, including wild mantis shrimp croquettes and black paella.

650,Zao,Restaurant,"The buzz: Zao opened in Ubon Ratchathani to support local farmers in Isaan and improve impressions Thai people have of Isaan as a whole. Now, they’ve just opened just behind Pridi cafe in Pridi Soi 25, serving real Isaan food—not the dishes adapted to cater to Bangkok tastes—in a space that’s even more hip than your average cafe. The vibes: Think of a sleek, photogenic cafe—but instead of coffee or croissants, they serve Isaan food. The bare concrete wall with a bright orange logo at the front really draws you into the space. The outdoor space is filled with trees, with floor-to-ceiling glass on one side to inject a little green, oasis feel into the concrete venue. With the food they serve, this place is a real definition of modern meets comfort. Owner, Nutthida “Eve” Palasak, used to be a fashion designer who worked with local communities in Isaan, and her design and fashion tastes definitely translated into her restaurant. The food: A lot of Isaan places in Bangkok serve dishes Bangkok people understand, like nam tok, but you won’t find them here. At first glance, we thought the menu was quite advanced, but on second thought—is it advanced or just so authentically local that we don’t often see it in Bangkok? All the ingredients are delivered from the same market they use at their Ubon branch twice a week, Warin Chamrap Municipal Food Market where villagers gather every day and sell whatever products they have. Somtam (get the hairy-fruited eggplant, B150) lovers, this is your pla ra paradise, they have three different kinds of pla ra for different dishes which took months to research and find. One of them is fermented for over two years. If you’re lucky, you might also get to meet 78-year-old grandma Jui who created a few dishes for the restaurant. Try the set of three jaew (chilli paste), featuring signature grandma Jui jaew, galangal jaew, and fresh Ubon chili jaew served with crispy pork skin and isaan vegetables (B300). The deep-fried pla yon (local Isaan freshwater fish) with garlic (B350) will really help with the spiciness. For something refreshing but still keeping it “Bangkok,” try the spicy watermelon with fermented fish sauce (B200). Their rice is also something to remember, straight from the local farmers in Yasothon to your plate (B30 for sticky rice). Why we’d come back: The whole Isaan region in general is very undervalued and underappreciated in Thailand, and this place is trying to bring more value to this culture through affordable dishes, cool architecture, and design. It’s definitely worth going and making it your new regular go-to somtam place.","A sleek café with a focus on authentic Isaan cuisine, this venue showcases dishes that reflect the region's true flavors. Fresh ingredients sourced from local markets complement a menu featuring unique items like three types of pla ra and grandma Jui's special recipes.

651,The White House Bangkok,Restaurant,"The buzz: After closing his Thonglor outpost, Latvian chef Aleksandrs “Alex” Nasikailovs has returned to Bangkok’s food scene with his latest fine-dining experience in Klong Toey. At White House Bangkok, cuisines collide: Alex steers from one destination to the next through theatrical presentations stemming from his 15-year culinary journey. The vibe: Surprisingly casual for fine-dining. Alex took over the two-story building, formerly housing Balee Laos, and transformed it into his own little empire. At the front of the building, you’ll see his dainty cafe where he sells handcrafted pastries; once inside the building, the ex-Salon Du Japonisant bartender Kei Sawada will greet you with his scientifically twisted cocktails. We are told that the second floor will eventually sport a more formal fine-dining experience. The food: Alex’s 10-course dining experience embodies a culinary travelog. Our journey begins with four starters: a translucent drop of catfish roe arriving on a charcoal, petal-like tartlet; a crispy doughnut stuffed with blue crab and topped with pickled cucumber; a wooden box of beetroot cracker with salmon mousse and roe; and slow-cooked iberico pork rillettes in wheat pillows. More visually pleasing is Tia Marra, served inside a crystal dome of ice. The chef then torches it with fire, revealing a French oyster resting in seaweed. Next is mackerel freshly sourced from Satun province and grilled with smoked mackerel mousse and salmon roe. His sea scallop with burnt butter hollandaise sauce and sturgeon caviar left us aching for more. The duck liver tortellini, however, was our favorite. The plumb-stuffed pasta was on point with a shred of black trumpet mushroom and birch sap syrup, which provides a subtle acidity and strange-but-pleasant sweetness. The two desserts included the refreshing granita Snowball which when cracked reveals fresh dragon fruit and a chocolate treasure trove at the end that had some surprising flavor combinations—think tom kha kai or goose cheese. The drinks: The only difference from Sawada’s days at Salon Du Japonisant is how he blends cultural uniqueness with science. Here, Sawada uses cut- ting-edge technology like the rotary evaporator (he claims that there are only eight places in Bangkok that use this equipment) to lend unique flavors to his cocktails. For B1,500, you’ll get seven cocktails to pair with all of the food above—imagine blue cheese with mango moscato, macha old-fashioneds, and a Japanese spicy wasabi sour. His cocktails are also available by the glass. The bitter negroni sees the luxe grape liquor Ruby Roman mixed with house-made grapefruit Campari, tonka bean rum, and Earl Grey whiskey with chocolate crumbles. Why we’d come back: With Alex and Sawada’s endless creativity, we can only imagine what they might come up with next. We might stop by to sample Sawada’s foie gras cocktail.","A casual yet refined dining experience awaits, showcasing a unique blend of global cuisines through theatrical presentations. Handcrafted pastries and innovative cocktails set the stage for a culinary journey, highlighted by dishes like duck liver tortellini and visually stunning desserts.

652,Chutie is Baking,Restaurant,"Inside Charoen 43, another up-and-coming space in Charoenkrung where artists and restaurateurs showcase their works, you can tell this is not your average hipster spot. Between bites and sips from desserts at Chutie is Baking, visitors will find themselves spellbound.  “We want our cakes to bewitch customers when they eat them,” says Chutima “Ae” Bovonratanachote, owner of Chutie is Baking, while referring to the brewing witch illustration in front of her store. Before she opened this shop, her cafe Sweet Pista had a solid reputation for both home cooking and sweets.  After relocating her Sweet Pista to Warehouse 30, Ae wanted to build her own baking lab where she could pour her heart into her passion for pastry.  Then, she found this 60-year-old jewelry shop’s safehouse and began renovating while keeping its essential structure intact, from the protruding metal lines and naked concrete walls to the second floor which occasionally doubles as an art space. Inside its ground floor, Chutie is Baking’s glass-enclosed kitchen, which takes almost three-fourths of the space, is a loud-and-proud testament to her baking passion. Looking through the glass, you can see Ae and her staff working their magic. The results are seasonal treats that are occasionally rotated, ranging from fruit parfaits to tartlets.   The first one we tried on our last visit was her mayongchid tartlet (B195), a mouthful of Thailand’s rare seasonal fruit sold one time a year. Ae places a generous portion of mayongchid atop the tartlet. It’s light and creamy, yet the fresh tang from mayongchid balances that sweetness well.   Another treat we admired was her lemon posset (B165), which arrived in a half-sliced lemon served with crispy shortbread. It’s a nod to her baking lab’s theme, Ae told, to bring this British’s classic creamy pudding on the list. There was a burst of citrussy but soothing scent of lemon in our first bite, followed by a thick creamy texture that helps tone it down.  It’s refreshing to see Bangkok still has some serious cafes that don’t overcharge customers for their adorably vain decorations and bland desserts. Chutie is Baking is more than a hipster trap.   All rights reserved to Coconuts Media Group.","A unique spot in Charoenkrung, this baking lab showcases seasonal desserts crafted with passion.

His quattro stagioni pizza (B380), meanwhile, has each quadrant generously filled with ham, mushroom, artichokes, and olives, offering a satisfying crunch to the crust. Like many Italian restaurants, Ailati also serves the staple tiramisu (B220) and excels at it: no soggy sponge and the mousse is not too sweet.

659,Antito,Restaurant,"The buzz: Michelin-starred Amerigo Sesti of the famed French fare at J’AIME is revisiting his roots with a new Italian restaurant. Casual it may be, but Sesti’s fine dining chops are still on display, flexing creative muscle to showcase authentic Italian cuisine.    The decor: Located on the  Hotel, Antito takes up the former space of big-name British chef Martin Blunos. Sesti’s new place is, however, not afraid to be playful, with texture, patterns, and color at every turn. The bold color scheme and chic, cheerful pop-art references–think Andy Warhol and Roy Lichenstein–add flamboyant charm. Sit in front of the semi-open kitchen to see Sesti work his magic or take in the air poolside. The food: Unlike his J’AIME creations, you can sample Sesti’s native dishes for a fraction of the price. For starters, go for the southern Italian staple prawn carpaccio (B620)–which looks more like an art installation than antipasti. Bouncy tiger prawns sit with candy tomatoes and eggplant infused with lemon oil, leaving diners with a fresh, clean palette. Equally delightful is the cavatelli arrabbiata (B330): hand-rolled shell-like pasta in rich arrabbiata sauce topped with mouthful portions of smoked ricotta. The highlight, and perhaps our favorite, is his pizza fritta (B380). Imagine the crispy deep-fried dough with a vibrant blow of sweet tomato sauce, combined with an unapologetically large spoonful of fresh burrata. The most punchily priced dish we try is the overnight-braised pork collar in marinated red wine sauce (B670). It’s majestically straightforward: tender and savory, accompanied by carrot and potato puree. His Meringata (B310) will challenge even the fiercest meringue aficionado; crack the outer shelf for the hidden ice cream inside.  The drink: Signature cocktails start at B350 and are as vibrant as the restaurant’s deco. Refresh yourself with a Lychee Pop, a light rum concoction with lychee syrup that comes with a large lychee popsicle that adds subtle, fruity flavors as it melts. Sesti also has a wide selection of wine at his disposal either served by the bottle or by the glass. Corkage runs B500.  Why’d we come back: A restaurant of this quality that doesn’t end in a bill that makes you weep is rare–and it’s close to BTS Surasak. The head chef is there everyday so the Sesti style is a guarantee. By Porpor Leelasestaporn",A casual yet vibrant Italian restaurant showcases authentic dishes by Michelin-starred chef Amerigo Sesti.

Pam says she caters to all five senses using five elements to enhance the food experience, and that manifests in clever ways. Dinner starts with an orange tree served in a tree pot. What appears to be a plump orange is in fact white chocolate encapsulating citrus kombucha. Chinese classics like dumplings are revamped as a modern-looking lamb tart, accompanied by house-made white tea broth infused with white mugwort. While frogs aren’t foreign to Chinese cuisine, Pam realizes that many people may not be bold enough to eat them. So she carefully wraps the meat in bamboo lattice, disguising it in a friendlier appearance, and serves it with a Chinese root and frog bone broth. The highlight, however, is 13-day hay-aged duck breast, Angus beef ribs, and rice bowls, which arrive on a lazy Susan—a familiar sight for anyone who grew up in a Thai-Chinese household. Don’t underestimate desserts here. From soy sauce ice cream topped with a translucent blown-sugar sphere filled with five spice, cinnamon, and fiery mala chocolate to a dessert trolley meant to represent Yaowarat’s crowd-gathering treats—think roasted chestnut mousse scones and sweet dumplings filled with custard lava—the sweet courses see Pam flexing her creative muscles.  The drinks: The antique-looking wine menu is speckled with Pam’s neatly hand-written manuscripts journaling her thought process in curating the selection. Potong’s cellar highlights uncommon and distinctive wineries from 15 countries. For example, Australia’s Borachio Pash Rash Pet Nat sparkling pinot noir (B2,500/bottle), or Germany’s Peter Jakob Kuhn 2016 biodynamic riesling brut (B2,800/bottle). Potong also provides a variety of kombucha drinks—the same that Pam incorporates into her menu creation (from B180/glass).  Why we’d come back: The titles that Pam has received over the years aren’t just for show, and the fact that we haven’t yet had a taste of her signature cocktails inside the opium bar is reason enough. But the way Potong reconnects with an overlooked cuisine has planning a return trip.         All images property of Coconuts Media","Nestled in bustling Sampeng, a progressive take on Thai-Chinese cuisine unfolds through a creative 20-course dinner.

Now, they’re getting into the inscrutably popular croissant game at their shop in Ari. Tucked inside Ari Soi 1, Qraft churns out Japanese-inspired croissants that, unsurprisingly, draw massive queues.  Using a special blend of Japanese flours and butters, Qraft offers light, flaky, and buttery croissants at reasonable prices. The plain croissant starts at B75, but other special filings will set you back B145. Highlights include the savory miso caramel and koicha, the thick syrupy, green tea mixture whose creaminess contrasts the flaky pastry.    Want something more unique? Try the waffuru (B125), a  butterfly-shaped croissant waffle laced with three different flavors: wild honey, yuzu honey, and savory miso cream.  When it comes to tea, unlike Peace’s traditionalist bent, Qraft offers a modern twist. Try Snow and Matcha (B185), fresh milk blended with matcha, or Pastel Hongcha (B145), a Taiwanese red tea with honey and milk, using tea leaves that have been aged for 48 hours.  For now, walk-in is unavailable.

693,Aksorn,Restaurant,"The buzz: Anything Thailand-based Australian chef David Thompson touches generates buzz. And Aksorn, his latest restaurant, which offers a time-traveling journey to the past via old cookbooks, has drawn tons of attention, if notadoration, from many in Bangkok’s food circles. The vibe: Perched on the fifth floor of Central: The Original Store on Charoenkrung, Aksorn is meant to embrace the building’s mid-century bookstore roots. Designed by Tripsters, the restaurant evokes that legacy with a contemporary touch. The homey,  sky towers through lush plants. The food: The focus here is forgotten, uncelebrated recipes procured from a selection of old cookbooks Thompson pored over during the 2020 lockdown. The full-course menu rotates periodically. Currently, it features 13 family recipes from renowned cookbook author and food columnist Nutchanand “Pao” Osathanond, reviving Thai culinary history during the turbulent period from the 1950s to the 1970s (B2,800++). Many are rare if not almost non-existent in today’s culinary scene. Think Miang Mhark (prawns and wild ginger wrapped with coral leaves); Song, a duck egg wafer filled with pork and salted fish; the pungent, spicy Nahmprik Nakornbarn, a relish of smoked fish and prawns from Rama V’s court brought to the fore by Pao’s grand-father; and Plamuek Tomkhem, a stew-like dish of squid braised in plain sugar and soy. The flavors are bold and sometimes unusual—sour, umami, smoky, aromatic—and the dishes are probably unlike any you may have had before. The drinks: Assuming alcohol will ever be allowed to be consumed in restaurants again, take advantage of the wine list, which is heavy on European and Aussie labels available in a pairing (B1,400++) or by the glass or bottle. Prefer cocktails? Aksorn has some clever options highlighting boutique spirits from Bootleggers. The tangy yet refreshing Cha Kam (B320) combines Thai gin Grandma Jinn, lime, salted lime, chakram (a salty herbaceous plant), and soda, while easy-drinking Butsaba (B320) presents a simple but effective combination of sugarcane-based Kosapan rum, citrus liqueur, honey,lime, and orange. Why we’d come back: Thompson’s new project is nothing like his previous ventures. Arguably as much for him as for diners, that’s exciting, and it shows in the unexpected classics, the in-your-face flavors, and the energy he and his team bring to the table.     All images courtesy of Aksorn.","A cozy, design-forward restaurant embraces mid-century bookstore roots while offering a unique culinary journey through forgotten Thai recipes.

After that, he joined Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s prestigious Mercato in Hong Kong and then took the reins at La Scala at the Sukhothai hotel early last year. At Tony’s, he’s setting up shop in the space that used to be Rocket.
